<p>Now that he needs my pimpin' but <a href="http://www.jpboodhoo.com/blog/GoingIndependent.aspx">Jean-Paul Boodhoo</a>, lured by the promise of&nbsp;wealth, fame and comely lasses of questionable virtue that the rest of us have enjoyed for so long,&nbsp;has joined the ranks of consultancy. So if you're looking for a&nbsp;software guy&nbsp;with great presentation skills, a variety of experience and impeccable footwear, call me. If you also want one who clearly doesn't sleep, I guess you can give him a shot.</p>
