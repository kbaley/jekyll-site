<p>This has nothing to do with technology or anything in particular. I was rummaging through my old documents folder and stumbled across something I had written many years ago that made me laugh.</p>
<p>Background: It was after a corporate to-do in which we were assigned teams named after tribes. Ours was called the Tatapa tribe. Other pertinent information: this was in Calgary which is (relatively) close to the Mackenzie River. And one of the members of our team was named Chris McPhee.</p>
<p><font color="#797979"><em>Tatapa tribe are we        <br />A hearty bunch as you can see         <br />Full of spirit and integrity         <br />Yes, a noble group the Tatapa tribe be </em></font></p>
<p><font color="#797979"><em>A noble tribe with a long and rich history        <br />So gather round and listen to me         <br />As I relate our grand past to thee         <br />So that thou may learn and like Tatapa be </em></font></p>
<p><font color="#797979"><em>Our tribe dates back many a century        <br />Back to the year 26 B.C.         <br />When a band of settlers traversed the country         <br />Settling on a location near present-day Calgary         <br />Settlers numbering thirty-three </em></font></p>
<p><font color="#797979"><em>Thirty-three men of integrity        <br />Led by a noble group of three         <br />Our namesake, Tatapa, and his wife, Baji </em></font></p>
<p><font color="#797979"><em>And the noblest of all, the noblest of the three        <br />And of the settlers numbering thirty-three         <br />A friend to Tatapa and his wife Baji         <br />Our beloved founder: Humpwhiffle Horseradish McGee </em></font></p>
<p><font color="#797979"><em>They travelled to the mountains, to a peaceful valley        <br />Carved by a river they named the River McGee         <br />(Which was later claimed by some twerp named Mackenzie) </em></font></p>
<p><font color="#797979"><em>But back then, it was the mighty McGee        <br />Named by Tatapa and his wife Baji         <br />In honour of their friend, Humpwhiffle McGee </em></font></p>
<p><font color="#797979"><em>It was there that they settled, there in the valley        <br />The thirty-three men of integrity         <br />With Tatapa, Baji, and Humpwhiffle McGee         <br />To lead the settlers, and thus to be free </em></font></p>
<p><font color="#797979"><em>So the settlers and their leaders three        <br />Tamed the land and the River McGee         <br />(Later claimed by that twit Mackenize)         <br />And set up shop there in the valley         <br />The very first industry the west did see </em></font></p>
<p><font color="#797979"><em>And what was it the west did see?        <br />What was the profound industry?         <br />The industry set up by McGee?         <br />Stop asking questions and you will see </em></font></p>
<p><font color="#797979"><em>McGee set up a brothel, there in the valley        <br />As grand a brothel as you ever did see         <br />(Well, as grand as you get for 26 B.C.)         <br />A brothel at the mouth of the River McGee         <br />(I hate that bastard Mackenzie) </em></font></p>
<p><font color="#797979"><em>And so, Humpwhiffle McGee was filled with glee        <br />Glee at the brothel on the River McGee         <br />Glee at the money it would bring for he         <br />He and his merry band of thirty-three         <br />Thirty-three men of integrity </em></font></p>
<p><font color="#797979"><em>Well, the astute reader will plainly see        <br />Thirty-three men does not a brothel be         <br />Thirty-three men of integrity         <br />And no one else as far as the eye could see         <br />There at the brothel on the River McGee         <br />Thirty-three men, alone in the valley         <br />Alone with Tatapa’s wife, the chaste Baji         <br />Thirty-three men of integrity </em></font></p>
<p><font color="#797979"><em>For Tatapa was away quite frequently        <br />Fishing for food in the River McGee         <br />And Baji would often get quite lonely         <br />Did I say thirty-three men of integrity?         <br />I meant thirty-three men of tenacity </em></font></p>
<p><font color="#797979"><em>So the tribe did thrive to 2001 A.D.        <br />(Thanks, in no small part, to Baji         <br />And the thirty-three men of tenacity) </em></font></p>
<p><font color="#797979"><em>And even today, you will see        <br />We adhere to the same tenacity         <br />(Though not quite to the same degree)         <br />And in a pinch, we can fake integrity </em></font></p>
<p><font color="#797979"><em>There are those of you who question my honesty        <br />You say to yourself, How can this be?         <br />Thirty-three men of questionable integrity?         <br />A man named Tatapa and his chaste wife Baji?         <br />A leader named Humpwhiffle Horseradish McGee?         <br />I don’t buy it. You’re lying to me. </em></font></p>
<p><font color="#797979"><em>Well, believe what you might I say to thee        <br />Believe what you truly believe to be.         <br />But let me take you back to 26 B.C.         <br />To a cool night in mid-February         <br />To a room in the brothel on the River McGee         <br />(If I ever lay my hands on that Mackenzie) </em></font></p>
<p><font color="#797979"><em>Tatapa was away as he was quite frequently        <br />Fishing along the River McGee         <br />Baji, on this night, was feeling quite randy         <br />As was our founder, Humpwhiffle McGee </em></font></p>
<p><font color="#797979"><em>And nine months later was born a baby        <br />Born to Tatapa’s wife Baji         <br />But not to Tatapa (although that’s what he did see)         <br />Born in secret to Humpwhiffle McGee </em></font></p>
<p><font color="#797979"><em>And on that night early 26 B.C.        <br />After the boy was born to Baji         <br />Humpwhiffle said, My dearest Baji.         <br />There is something I must confess to thee </em></font></p>
<p><font color="#797979"><em>What is it? What troubles thee?        <br />My name is not Humpwhiffle Horseradish McGee, said he,         <br />I changed it when I was not much older than three </em></font></p>
<p><font color="#797979"><em>Baji looked at her leader incredulously        <br />But why? Why did you change it? asked she         <br />Humpwhiffle looked at his feet dejectedly         <br />The children would laugh. The children would tease me.         <br />They thought my old name was funny. </em></font></p>
<p><font color="#797979"><em>Baji replied, &quot;No. That can not be.        <br />How could they laugh at one as noble as thee?&quot;         <br />&quot;But they did laugh. They laughed at me.         <br />They taunted and mocked and ridiculed me.         <br />But not when I became Humpwhiffle Horseradish McGee.&quot; </em></font></p>
<p><font color="#797979"><em>Humpwhiffle wrapped his arms ‘round Baji        <br />And sobbed for an hour until no tears had he         <br />&quot;Are you ashamed? Are you ashamed of me? </em></font></p>
<p><font color="#797979"><em>I lied to thee </em></font></p>
<p><font color="#797979"><em>I am not the man you think of me </em></font></p>
<p><font color="#797979"><em>I am not the noble Humpwhiffle Horseradish McGee&quot; </em></font></p>
<p><font color="#797979"><em>Baji stroked his head tenderly        <br />Cry no more, my noble McGee.         <br />For I will name our son after thee         <br />After the true name of Humpwhiffle Horseradish McGee         <br />So that the future will know of thee         <br />And know what you brought to this valley         <br />This grand brothel on the River McGee </em></font></p>
<p><font color="#797979"><em>So what does this have to do with me?        <br />What bearing does it have in 2001 A.D.? </em></font></p>
<p><font color="#797979"><em>Well, that child, the child that was born to Baji        <br />The boy that bore the true name of Humpwhiffle Horseradish McGee         <br />His ancestors live on right here in Calgary         <br />They live among us, among you and me         <br />The ancestors of Humpwhiffle Horseradish McPhee</em></font></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>When I initially posted this, Chris was quick with a response:</p>
<p><font color="#787878"><em>I did not know Humpwhiffle, and he didn't know me,        <br />For he lived long ago, in 26 B.C.         <br />But it wasn't Horseradish who visited Baji,         <br />On that fateful night by the River McGee,         <br />If my sources are right (and why shouldn't they be),         <br />It was one of the locals called Haberdash Baley!</em></font></p>
