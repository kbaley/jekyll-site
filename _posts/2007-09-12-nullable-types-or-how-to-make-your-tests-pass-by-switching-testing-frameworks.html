<p>The hillbilly is feeling brief so I'll cut to the chase. The following test succeeds in NUnit but fails in MbUnit:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; decimal? nullableDecimal = 100m * 3.281m;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assert.AreEqual( 328.1m, nullableDecimal );</font></p>
<p>The error in MbUnit: Equal assertion failed: [[328.1]]!=[[328.100]]</p>
<p>The way to get this to pass in MbUnit (and still in NUnit) is:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; decimal? nullableDecimal = 100m * 3.281m;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assert.AreEqual( 328.1m, nullableDecimal.Value );</font></p>
<p>If you write out the value of nullableDecimal to the console you will indeed see that it is 328.100 so I suppose technically, MbUnit is correct in claiming that the values aren't equal, although it sure looks like it's comparing string representations rather than actual values.</p>
<p>So in this case, my opinion is that NUnit handles things better because it allows you to use the variable in a more natural way. I.E. It doesn't shove in your face the fact that the variable is nullable.</p>
<p>Caveat: Don't take this as an endorsement for NUnit. The hillbilly still prefers MbUnit because he likes to pretend it stands for "Mountain boy unit".</p>
