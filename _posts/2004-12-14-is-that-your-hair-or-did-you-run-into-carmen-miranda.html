<p>&nbsp;Y&rsquo;know, I have no real clue what to write about at the moment but I feel an overwhelming urge to pontificate so let&rsquo;s see where the keyboard takes me.</p>
<p>Weather&rsquo;s always a nice generic way to start. It&rsquo;s been kind of cold here the last two days. Weather.com claims the daytime high has been in the low 20s but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s been that high. It&rsquo;s been cold enough that I&rsquo;ve had to wear pants during the day which, I have to admit, has drastically reduced the number of scrapes I usually get on my legs when I let the dogs off their leashes.</p>
<p>Syd&rsquo;s Christmas concert was last Friday during the day. It was quite an elaborate production overall. Syd&rsquo;s class did a short rendition of The Nutcracker with the most adorable sugar-plum fairies anyone with a daughter in the class has ever seen. I brought the leftover skittles from the <a href="http://kyle.baley.org/personal/archive/2004/12/10/225.aspx">night before</a> to ensure quality control (&ldquo;Booo! Get off the stage!&rdquo;). Thankfully for Syd&rsquo;s continued admittance at St. Andrew&rsquo;s, the show was pretty good (as in: it was easy to ignore the segments with kids I didn&rsquo;t know; oh, come on, you know you do it, too) and I had to settle with actually eating the skittles.</p>
<p>So as I was showering this morning, I grabbed Liza&rsquo;s shampoo because mine had run out. My brand is L&rsquo;Oreal Kids Strawberry Almond shampoo mostly because it&rsquo;s Sydney&rsquo;s and with as little hair as I have, any shampoo I buy would expire before I used it all. Anyway, Liza&rsquo;s brand was some obscure company but emblazened on the bottle was something like, &ldquo;Now with avocado!&rdquo; I checked her conditioner, and it was avocado-less but apparently has the goodness of &ldquo;wheat protein&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m guessing ninety percent of the buyers of this shampoo had no idea avocado and wheat protein was actually good for their hair until they read it on the bottle. Furthermore, I bet the science behind such claims is probably as rigorous as what I do to make a sandwich (&ldquo;Hmmm&hellip;wonder how long THIS has been in the fridge&hellip;oh well, still smells okay&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The people that sell these shampoos are marketing geniuses. If I could add &ldquo;now with the emboldening power of guava&rdquo; or &ldquo;Refreshing marmalade essence! It&rsquo;s not just for toast anymore!&rdquo; to my generic vat of goop and sell it as a brand new product, I&rsquo;d move to a Caribbean island and live my life out there. The people that came up with this little scam rank up there with the Baking Soda industry (&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an idea! Let&rsquo;s tell people to open the box, put it in their refrigerator for a month, then throw it away!&rdquo;). Or whoever first put &ldquo;eau de toilette&rdquo; on a bottle of alcohol and charged people $300 to douse themselves in it.</p>
<p>Finally, my brothers will be proud to know that I have successfully introduced Potty-Mouth-Friday to the Bahamas. We haven&rsquo;t grown bold enough to practice in fast food restaurants the way they do in Manitoba but we&rsquo;re growing. Racial-Slur Wednesday and Repentence Thursday have been met with&hellip;ummm&hellip;less enthusiasm.</p>
<p>A couple of lines on Syd and the weather and a nice little ditty on hair products. Yeah, that&rsquo;ll do.</p>
