<p>We are now the proud owners of a one-acre lot in the Bahamas! Just accepted the seller's counteroffer and are waiting for the paperwork to make its way through the lawyers. Then a little groveling at the bank and we're done.</p>
<p>Contract law being what it is in the Bahamas, nothing is final until the contract is signed so there's still a chance someone may make a higher offer before we're done. But we're celebrating anyway. Got a pretty good deal, we think, but I'm not going poking around for evidence just in case I find out we got screwed.</p>
<p>Check out pictures of the place <a href="http://baley.vanmeurs.org/kyle/gallery/15.aspx">here</a>. It's not much to look at yet but picture it with nice stuff on it.</p>
