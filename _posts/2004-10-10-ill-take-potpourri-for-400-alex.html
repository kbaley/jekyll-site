<div class="Section1">
<p class="MsoNormal">A few things of note in recent days. Firstly, we were the proud owners of a baby bird for about a day and a half. Liza's friend brought it over one afternoon from who knows where and Syd promptly named it Tweety. I don't know my birds so have no clue what kind it was. Wasn't a pet store bird, that's for sure. Anyway, it stayed the night in an empty Schmirnoff Ice box and I put an end to the happiness the following evening on the grounds that&hellip;well, who brings a baby bird into a house unannounced? Nonetheless, Syd was pretty upset when we let Tweety go and even had herself a little cry a couple of days later because she &ldquo;missed Tweety&rdquo;. Odd how the logic of parenthood has overridden my unconditional acceptance of strange animals in my house.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Went to church for the first time in many sins today. Liza's been feeling guilty (like every Catholic should) about not going and friends of ours recommended a church that wasn't quite as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080455/combined">Reverend James</a>-ish as the others in the Bahamas. My chest didn't burn too much when I walked through the doors so it's either a sign that God hasn't forsaken me or that He's got <a href="http://www.bertisevil.tv/">bigger</a> fish to fry (so to speak). Service was good, people were friendly, and Syd was bored out of her skull. We'll be back next Sunday.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Got a copy of The Sims 2 last week. I've heard it's already on track to be the best-selling game ever and it's easy to see why. Syd loves it. She spent an hour and a half building The Smudge Family (parents Kyle &amp; Jessica Smudge, daughter Sam Smudge, and aunt Tita Smudge) and has been in here every five minutes while I type this asking if we can play some more.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Had the first of five scheduled visits with her teacher last week. Not much to tell. Teacher seems nice and Syd's adapting well to Reception/Kindergarten. One item of note is that <a href="http://baley.vanmeurs.org/kyle/gallery/image/136.aspx">Anthony</a> is apparently no longer Syd's boyfriend at school (not sure how he feels about the break-up &lsquo;cause I don't think he really knew about the courtship). The new flame is a boy called Oliver. Seems all the girls in reception like him. When I asked Syd why that is, her older-than-her-years response was, &ldquo;because he's new&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Off to bake me some pumpkin pies. Happy Thanksgiving to all Canucks!</p>
