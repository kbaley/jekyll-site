<p>Small whinge today. After eight versions, I'm still waiting on MSN Messenger to offer a "Block this entire group" feature. I work remotely and use MSN as my preferred method of communication. There are times when I'd like to be able to block the Friends and Family groups. Blocking these people individually takes time. Plus, it's a lot easier on my psyche to block a generic group than to right-click my mother and tell her I don't want to talk to her for the foreseeable future.</p>
