<div class="Section1">
<p>&nbsp;So Syd comes home today and says, &#8220;I know the colours of the rainbow, daddy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How adorable,&#8221; I think to myself and I answer, &#8220;That&#8217;s nice, honey, is pink your favorite?&#8221;</p>
<p>The response: &#8220;There&#8217;s no pink, daddy. It goes: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Look it up. Not only are the colours correct, they&#8217;re in the right order. I believe I was in about grade 8 when I learned this, and I had the advantage of being able to read so the mnemonic ROY G. BIV helped me through that particular question on the exam. I still don&#8217;t know what colour &#8220;indigo&#8221; is (which didn&#8217;t stop me from getting into a heated argument with Syd about it.</p>
<p>In other news, in a slap-in-the-face to island living, I am know working on three different contracts as well as trying to study for an actuarial exam. This is the Caribbean; I should be sipping margaritas on a *#$^% hammock.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll close with cheers to the <a href="http://www.scrolllock.nl/">Fitusis</a> and Oulettes of the world. And a toast to the Pozernicks. And what the hell, here&#8217;s a shout-out to the Giesbrechts, too.</p>
