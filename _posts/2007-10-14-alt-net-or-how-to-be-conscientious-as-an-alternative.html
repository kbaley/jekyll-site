<p>The conversations on changing the name of ALT.NET have (thankfully) died down and I don't want to resurrect them in the mailing list which is why I'm posting this here, tongue firmly in cheek. I just realized I've had&nbsp;the perfect name all along in my category list: Conscientious Coding. The underlying tenet from the <a href="http://kyle.baley.org/ConscientiousCodingIsTheNewTDD.aspx" target="_blank">original post</a> (and let's ignore the misguided critique on TDD, shall we. So young was I in mid-2006): Someone else is going to have to deal with your &amp;*%$ after you leave. Be nice to them.</p>
