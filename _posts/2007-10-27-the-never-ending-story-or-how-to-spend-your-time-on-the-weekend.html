<p>To do list for the day:</p>
<ol>
<li>Catch up with the latest posts to <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/altnetconf/" target="_blank">altnetconf</a>&nbsp;group</li>
<li>Check my RSS feeds for new posts</li>
<li>Read the four new posts from <a href="http://www.ayende.com/Blog/" target="_blank">Ayende</a> that have arisen since I started step 2</li>
<li>Go to bathroom &lt;optional&gt;</li>
<li>Repeat ad infinitum</li>
</ol>
<p>In light of this new schedule, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask all of you bloggers and ALT.NET contributors out there to preface your posts and e-mails accordingly with "Relevant to Kyle" or "Not relevant to Kyle" from now on. Try to err on the side of my lack of sleep.</p>
