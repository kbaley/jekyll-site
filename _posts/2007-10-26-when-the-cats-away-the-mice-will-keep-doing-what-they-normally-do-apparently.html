<p>So the family's away for the weekend and I'm left to my own devices. First time with the TV to myself in many moons and what do I watch? <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0363328/" target="_blank">Drake &amp; Josh</a> on Nickelodeon. And I don't mind admitting that I laughed. A lot.</p>
<p>I'm not a big sitcom person. The only one I've watched somewhat regularly in the last ten years is <a href="http://us.imdb.com/find?s=all&amp;q=arrested+development" target="_blank">Arrested Development</a>&nbsp;(and yes, that includes when <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0098904/" target="_blank">Seinfeld</a> was on). It's more out of lack of patience than any critique on the shows, because when I do watch them, they're usually pretty good. But I've seen a lot of Drake &amp; Josh because I have an eight-year-old daughter. I would catch snippets of it here and there while she watched it and laugh at the antics.&nbsp;Tonight, it had just started as I was about to switch over to play some Wii and I got hooked in.</p>
<p>Not sure what it is about the show. It's not particularly original or well-written. I think it's the slapstick nature of it. Not since <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0075596/" target="_blank">Three's Company</a> have I laughed so much at people's overblown reactions. Characters fall down, jump over sofas, run into walls, do double- and triple-takes, etc, etc and so on and so forth. I swear I saw one character slip on a banana peel at some point. Tonight's episode had both title characters giving CPR to a supposedly dead hamster. It's very old school and it's very funny. Even the missus will sit and watch when it's on.</p>
<p>Kudos to pretty much the whole cast but I have to single out <a href="http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0669681/" target="_blank">Josh Nichols</a>. He's like the 21st century love child of Charlie Chaplin and Lucille Ball. Well, that might be a little hyperbolic but there's definitely some John Ritter in there somewhere. The kid can take a pratfall like few others on TV. His double-takes last about thirty seconds. When he trips on something, you can practically see the walls shake. His stint on Drake &amp; Josh can't last much longer without it looking creepy that they still live at home with their parents but I have little doubt that Josh Nichols' acting career will continue on in some form.</p>
<p>I've noticed that I compared Drake &amp; Josh to some pretty heavyweight comedy shows. And upon reflection, I stand by it. It may not survive the annals of TV history given the genre it's in and the cynicism people generally aim at it. But damned if I don't laugh loud and hard when I watch it.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the weekend, I'm off to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.clubpenguin.com" target="_blank">Club Penguin</a>.</p>
