<p>So Syd's been taking swimming lessons three times a week and she's starting to get pretty good. Good enough to get herself far enough away from the edge that she can't get back, anyway. There's something to be said for keeping a kid scared of the water. Much easier on my own mental health.</p>
<p>Liza and I have been waffling back and forth on whether to buy a house to rent out or to buy land we can build our dream house on in a few years. Market conditions are very good now so we're pretty sure we want to buy something now 'cause lord knows how much it'll cost when we do get our own place. As it is, the going mortgage interest rate for foreigners is between 7.5% and 8.5% depending on how much cleavage Liza is showing.</p>
<p>Also gearing up for our trip to London. We're making two changes from last years trip:<br />- We're staying a few days later<br />- Syd's not coming</p>
<p>That last point is going to cause some drama because she still thinks she is...</p>
