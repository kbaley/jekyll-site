<p>I removed the vacation diagram from the last post 'cause it gave me a headache whenever I looked at it. It's still up at <a href="http://baley.vanmeurs.org/kyle/gallery/image/183.aspx">http://baley.vanmeurs.org/kyle/gallery/image/183.aspx</a> if you're feeling a little sadomasochistic. Suffice it to say there actually were last minute changes but I...don't remember what they were.</p>
<p>Full update to come later this week where the following questions will be answered:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is western Manitoba's version of Bennifer?
</li>
<li>When is it appropriate to use rock-paper-scissors in a round of golf?
</li>
<li>How long is the average alpaca mating ritual?
</li>
<li>What exactly ARE Oompah Loompahs?
</li>
<li>How many hairstyles is it possible to have at the same time?
</li>
<li>Does a father truly not love his daughter if he refuses to smuggle a pig across the border for her?
</li>
<li>If a 13-year-old girl refuses to eat perogies because they'll make her fat, why does she throw four f*#%ing pizza pops in the microwave half an hour later?</li>
</ul>
<p>OK, I don't really have an answer to the last one but the question had to be asked...</p>
