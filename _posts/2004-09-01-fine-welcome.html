<p>Arrived from Washington this morning to a country preparing for Hurricane Frances. She should hit our shores sometime Friday. In the meantime, we are holing up in Pedro's now-ironically-named property, East of Paradise. I'm kind of pumped but we have to put the trampoline in the pool to keep it from flying away and I'm not looking forward to bringing it out again. Perhaps there's a new Olympic sport in there somewhere...</p>
<p><strong>10:00PM<br /></strong>Starting to get a little breezy. We've closed most of the hurricane shutters. Got a bit of sandbagging to do tomorrow but that's about it.</p>
