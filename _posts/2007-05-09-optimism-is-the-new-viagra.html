<p>I think one of the many issues leading to the proliferation of anti-depressants these days is that it's too easy to be a skeptic. Or rather, it's too hard to be an optimist. For any length of time at least.</p>
<p>With instant access to pretty much any piece of information we want, it's much easier to debunk pretty much any myth out there. In fact, this is the primary reason for the existence of things like <a href="http://www.snopes.com" target="_blank">Snopes</a> and <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/mythbusters.html" target="_blank">MythBusters</a>. (C'mon guys, it was *cool* thinking I could kill someone dropping a penny off the Empire State Building.)</p>
<p>Which is why many people will react with skepticism to anything new or outside of their comfort zone, as can be evidenced by the comments attached to any clip on YouTube that shows someone doing something <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVqRT_kCOLI" target="_blank">extraordinary</a>.</p>
<p>Try this test: What's your reaction when someone goes racing by in traffic in clear violation of everyone else's safety? "I hope the cops get him"? "I wish I could pull him over myself and give him a piece of my mind"?</p>
<p>What about "I wonder if there is someone injured in that car and the driver is trying to get him to a hospital"? Or "I hear ya, buddy, it sucks getting stuck at another appointment and being late for your job interview"? Or "Good luck with the new baby!"</p>
<p>But it's too easy just to assume it's a reckless driver. Maybe half the time it's true. Maybe even ninety percent of the time. But not always. And the next time you're screaming through a residential area because you forgot your kid's soccer practice now ends at 4:00 instead of 4:30, you don't necessarily stop to think what it would be like as one of the other drivers you're whistling past.</p>
<p>Of course, it doesn't help that the same medium that lets us verify facts before they've even been uttered has led to an onslaught of scams and cons. And that's why I'm not advocating you relax your common sense, just your negative initial assumptions. Chances are, the new gizmo on TV doesn't slice, dice, *and* do your taxes as advertised but maybe you still need something that slices and dices at least.</p>
