<p>I hate small talk for the most part. I hate the fact that people feel the need to fill an empty silence with mindless blather about the weather, some sports event, or &ldquo;didja hear&rdquo;s (usually followed by recounting of some death somewhere in the world). Just once, I&rsquo;d like to say to someone I have just met, &ldquo;Y&rsquo;know, just before I got here, I had one of those life-altering dumps that feels like you&rsquo;ve performed an exorcism so I&rsquo;m not really in the mood to speak at the moment. Certainly not about the intricacies of why it&rsquo;s two degrees warmer today than it was yesterday, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A maid comes in every morning where I work and we invariably have the same conversation EVERY SINGLE DAY:</p>
<p>She: &ldquo;Hello&rdquo;<br /> Me: &ldquo;Hi&rdquo;<br /> She: &ldquo;How you doin&rsquo;?&rdquo;<br /> Me: &ldquo;Fine and you&rdquo;<br /> She: &ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m fine. How&rsquo;s your baby?&rdquo;<br /> Me: &ldquo;She ran off with gypsies.&rdquo;<br /> She: &ldquo;Oh that&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t tell her Syd took off with gypsies but the conversation is so automatic, I can&rsquo;t even remember what I actually say anymore. (Side note: I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;ve mentioned Syd&rsquo;s five and not technically a baby but one of the corollaries of small talk is that after a certain period of time, you aren&rsquo;t allowed to correct a past mistake lest you make the other party feel foolish).</p>
<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s not what I came here to talk about.</p>
<p>It occurred to me yesterday that I&rsquo;ve forgotten what it&rsquo;s like to be a child. Very dangerous given my motto at the top of the screen. Two events triggered this revelation. The first was suppertime. I was working on something on the computer and Liza was preparing Syd&rsquo;s food. Shortly after she and Syd sat down, the phone rang in the office and she got up to answer it. After a couple of minutes with her on the phone, I got up and went to the kitchen. Syd was munching away slowly with a strange look on her face. It was kind of a sad look and for some reason, I felt guilty all of a sudden.</p>
<p>Do you remember ever eating alone as a child? It&rsquo;s not a fun feeling usually. Essentially, we dumped Syd at the table, told her to eat, then left her there. &ldquo;Not such a big deal&rdquo;, you say, &ldquo;I do it all the time.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s true, it&rsquo;s not that big a deal. Teach the kid that alone time is a fact of life and I&rsquo;m not suggesting we need to coddle her every time she decides to ingest. It just struck me that I had forgotten the feeling of eating alone as a child.</p>
<p>Second incident isn&rsquo;t really an incident but an awareness of my answers to Syd&rsquo;s questions after I got to thinking of the dinner episode. She will often ask my permission to do something or if we can do something together. Like doing a puzzle. Sometimes I&rsquo;ll say yes and we&rsquo;ll do the puzzle and go on our merry way bonding like Super Glue. Other times, I&rsquo;m tired or have something else to do so I&rsquo;ll say no. The thing is, I don&rsquo;t put any thought into my decision for things like that. Most of the time it&rsquo;s automatic. So what if I can&rsquo;t work on the puzzle with Syd? It&rsquo;s just a puzzle, she&rsquo;ll find something else to do. And she usually does.</p>
<p>But I remember asking if I could do something mundane and being so disappointed when I wasn&rsquo;t allowed. And on the flipside, there&rsquo;s that feeling of elation when Mom or Dad say, &ldquo;Sure, go ahead, knock yourself out.&rdquo; As parents, it&rsquo;s just a game or a puzzle or something little like that. But to a child, being allowed or disallowed to do anything fun is perceived as a life-altering event and most of the time, I ignore the weight Syd puts into my answers.</p>
<p>Again, I don&rsquo;t intend to spend any more time agonizing over whether Syd can play Xbox or ride her bike. Just that I had forgotten.</p>
<p>Oh, more of Syd&rsquo;s pics <a href="http://baley.vanmeurs.org/kyle/gallery/30.aspx">here</a>. And some October pics <a href="http://baley.vanmeurs.org/kyle/gallery/31.aspx">here</a>.</p>
