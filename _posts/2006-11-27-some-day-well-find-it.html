<p>Sesame Street Live in the Bahamas. That's as cultural as you get in Nassau. And the troupe was welcomed with open arms, then dropped off at the gymnasium in a local sports centre. Sounds unceremonious but when I told others where the venue was, it was usually met with a nod that said, "wow, fancy schmancy".</p>
<p>And so it was that we found ourselves on the way to the show yesterday morning. On the way, Syd and I had a discussion on our favorite characters. Her favorite is Elmo which should make the marketers of Tickle-Me-Elmo proud because I'm pretty sure that's the only reason she even knows who Elmo is. Seriously, I don't think Syd has watched a single episode of Sesame Street in her life.</p>
<p>When the question came to me, I said Kermit the Frog because of the memories I have of his journalistic skills. Particularly the way he seemed to be the only sane one in a sea of chaos. I also mentioned Bert because I empathize with someone whose obsession was cute twenty years go but in today's world is kinda creepy. Syd's response: "Who's Bert?"</p>
<p>I'm sure she regrets bringing that up because it launched a tirade of nostalgia the likes of which have not been seen since she inadvertently asked, "Daddy, what's a Smurf?" one day during a routine watching of <strong>I Love the 80s</strong>.</p>
<p>The rest of the drive was spent mostly in obscure song ("It's Not Easy Being Green", "Pe-e-e-e-ro-gie", "Keep On Trying, La la la" and, of course, "One-two-three-FOUR-five-six-seven-eight-NINE-ten-eleven-twelve") with brief interludes to try to explain the aliens who went "yep, yep, yep, yep, uh HUH, uh HUH" and "brrrrrrrring!".</p>
<p>Despite dad's semi-coherent ramblings, she was still raring to go when we got there. And it was suitably entertaining for young and old. Lots of singing and dancing. Lots of colour. Lots of happy kids.</p>
<p>And it was nice to see the Polically Correct Police haven't affected Oscar too much. Was half expecting him to be living in a hippie commune rather than a trashcan these days.</p>
