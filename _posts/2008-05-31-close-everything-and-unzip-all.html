<p>Couple o' quick productivity tips.</p>
<p>The first I posted on Twitter yesterday. That is, in Visual Studio, you can map Ctrl-Alt-F4 so that it closes all open document windows. It's a noticeable time saver for me because I often get to the stage where I'm holding down Ctrl-F4 for about ten seconds waiting for it to close everything up.</p>
<p>Instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Visual Studio, go to Tool | Options </li>
<li>Under Environment select Keyboard </li>
<li>In Show commands containing, enter Window.CloseAllDocuments. You should get a single entry in the listbox below it </li>
<li>Put the cursor in Press shortcut keys and press Ctrl-Alt-F4. </li>
<li>Click OK </li>
</ul>
<p>You can use whatever combination you like but check to see if it's used by something else. I originally wanted Ctrl-Shift-F4 but ReSharper was using it for &quot;Close recent tool&quot;. Haven't determined what that means yet.</p>
<p>Next tip. When I get zip files, ninety-nine percent of the time, I do the same thing with them: Extract to &lt;foldername&gt;. That requires right-clicking on the file, navigating to the 7-Zip folder in the context menu, and selecting the appropriate option. I'm using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" target="_blank">7-Zip</a> as my archiver of choice primarily because it's free, fast, and hasn't gone the Paintshop Pro route of bloatedness like WinZip has.</p>
<p>(NOTE: You can configure 7-Zip's context menu to get rid of things you don't use, like Zip and E-mail. You can also make the menu non-cascading. The options are a little buried in the application but you'll find them.)</p>
<p>7-Zip has a command-line version, as I suspect most archivers do. So after a browse through the documentation, I created a batch file as follows:</p>
<pre name="code">@echo off
set zipPath=%~dpn1
&quot;C:Program Files7-Zip7z.exe&quot; x &quot;%1&quot; -o%zipPath% -y
pause</pre>
<p>I've completely forgotten what the value after &quot;set zipPath=&quot; means but it was on the interwebs here somewhere. Sorry folks, the Hillbilly can't be expected to remember everything he did last month. Like if he showered or not.</p>
<p>The next step here is to link this batch file to .zip files. I went the low-tech way by right-clicking a zip file, and selecting Choose Program... from the Open With context menu:</p></p>
<p>Select your newly-minted batch file and now zip files are extracted to &lt;foldername&gt; with a single click (or with an Enter for the keyboarders).</p>
<p>Notice that the zip file has a &quot;pause&quot; in the last line. That's precautionary and can be removed if you like. I added it so I could see if there were any errors during the process.</p>
<p>That is all.</p>
