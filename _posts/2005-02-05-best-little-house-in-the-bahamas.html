<div class="Section1">
<p>My mind usually wanders when I&#8217;m trying to study. These days, that probably means I have some sort of acronymic disorder. (I started reading an article on it once but couldn&#8217;t be bothered to finish.) The good part is that I can brain-dump my random thoughts thus adding to the guilt I feel for shirking my studying. Welcome to 2005 where there are many levels to slacking off.</p>
<p>Anyway, it occurred to me that once our property deal goes through, we&#8217;re going to have a good chunk of land. It also occurred to me that almost every good-sized chunk of land in the Bahamas has a name. There are the usual generic names like &#8220;Song of the Sea&#8221;, &#8220;Hard Bargain&#8221;, and &#8220;Brought to You By Alimony&#8221; along with the plays on people&#8217;s names, like &#8220;Rose House&#8221; and &#8220;Full Sayle&#8221; (although that one&#8217;s owned by the Stanhopes).</p>
<p>So I started thinking of potential names. The obvious choice, of course, is The Hillbaley Ho Down and Extravaganza, although people may get confused with the &#8220;baley&#8221; part so maybe &#8220;Hillbilly Ho Down and Extravaganza&#8221; would be better. Gotta think of the resale value, you know. Of course, there&#8217;s no way Liza would go for this so I need alternatives. People like making up plays on family names that sound clever almost once so I thought I&#8217;d give that a try, but for some reason Baley Dancer doesn&#8217;t roll off the tongue the way I&#8217;d like. Maybe my mom&#8217;s maiden name? Nah, my grandparents already lived in a house called The Crow&#8217;s Nest. I couldn&#8217;t take that away from them.</p>
<p>Then I thought of my grandmother&#8217;s maiden name and the possibilities came flooding in. In the end, I think I&#8217;ll keep it simple (as befits our family). So in honour of my great grandmother of whom I have many fond memories, may she rest in peace, we will christen our new property: Hoar House.</p>
