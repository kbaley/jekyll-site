<p>You'd think I have nothing better to do on a Saturday night. You'd&nbsp;think right...</p>
<p>I have <a href="http://kyle.baley.org/Images/Exported-2006-05-06.vssettings">attached</a>, for your viewing pleasure, the settings file for my installation of Visual Studio 2005. Recently re-configured because uninstalling ReSharper left them in such a state and I had to reset and rebuild them. ReSharper did say something about backing up my settings but Jayzus knows where I put them.</p>
<p>Here's a summary of the changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consolas font. <a href="http://www.jameskovacs.com/blog/ConsolasAvailableForVS2005.aspx">Because</a> <a href="http://www.bristowe.com/blog/2005/07/21/Consolas+Is+Da+Bomb.aspx">I was</a> <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ConsolasFontFamilyNowAvailableForDownload.aspx">told to</a>. But at 11pt because 10pt seemed too small. Guess I'm getting old after all.
</li>
<li>Display fifteen items in the Recent Projects list. Who works on less than six projects?
</li>
<li>Solution Explorer, Server Explorer, and Properties Window docked along the left. I like them here because they are closer to the code I'm looking at. And when I debug, they are docked along the right so it's always obvious whether I'm debugging or not.
</li>
<li>Spacing and formatting. Some years ago, a good friend and a developer I respect highly suggested the spacing scheme I currently use and I love it. In general, there are spaces within parentheses, both for function calls and in expressions. Casts are the exception so that they stand out as casts. I find this makes code much, much easier to read as does most extra whitespace in generally.</li>
</ul>
<p>So export your own settings to back them up and <a href="http://kyle.baley.org/Images/Exported-2006-05-06.vssettings">check them out</a> if you're curious and/or brave. Note that the formatting changes&nbsp;are for C# because at the moment, it's all I code in.</p>
