<p><i>&lt;to the tune of The Beverly Hillbillies&gt;<a href="http://kyle.baley.org/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/2deee06d8ced_129BE/bc_final_2.jpg"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="182" alt="bc_final" src="/assets/bc_final_thumb.jpg" width="244" align="right" border="0" /></a></i></p>
<p>Come and listen to a story 'bout a blogger named Kyle<br />Didn't have much to say but he said it with some style<br />Day after day, he'd talk of TDD<br />AJAX and patterns and working remotely</p>
<p><i>Far, that is. Distant. Boondocks.&nbsp; </i></p>
<p>Kyle blogged on and off for a little more'n a year<br />Then the CodeBetter folks said, "blog on over here!" <br />Said "we're big fans of your posts on hooch and 'shine"<br />So he packed up his feed and left his home behind.</p>
<p><i>Virtually, that is. Forsaken. But not forgotten.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alas, it is the end of an era. The Coding Hillbilly has a <a href="http://www.codebetter.com/blogs/kyle.baley/default.aspx" target="_blank">new home</a> (which explains the irony of the <a href="http://kyle.baley.org/NewLookOrQuotHowToSkinABlogquot.aspx">new skin</a>). I've been called up to the majors over at <a href="http://www.CodeBetter.com">www.CodeBetter.com</a>. This place has been a nice little starter trailer but you can go only so long without indoor plumbing. Not sure what I'll do without <a href="http://kyle.baley.org/CategoryView,category,dasBlog.aspx">dasBlog</a> as my default blog-filler now.</p>
<p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheCodingHillbilly" target="_blank">The feed</a> will (theoretically) stay the same for those of you who want to continue reading my ramblings without subscribing to the CodeBetter main feed. <a href="http://kyle.baley.org">http://kyle.baley.org</a> will continue to point here to minimize broken links but I've moved <a href="http://www.codinghillbilly.com">http://www.codinghillbilly.com</a> to point to the new location (again, theoretically).</p>
<p>See y'all on the other side</p>
<p>Kyle the Promoted</p>
