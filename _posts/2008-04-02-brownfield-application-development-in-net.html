<p>Suppose it would have been more appropriate to make today's announcement yesterday but c'est la vie, que sera sera, ou est la biblioteque and all that.</p>
<p>I'm writing a book with <a href="http://www.igloocoder.com" mce_href="http://www.igloocoder.com" target="_blank">Donald Belcham</a> on practices and techniques that can be used on <a href="http://www.igloocoder.com/archive/2007/12/23/what-is-brownfield.aspx" mce_href="http://www.igloocoder.com/archive/2007/12/23/what-is-brownfield.aspx" target="_blank">brownfield applications</a>. The official site is at <a href="http://www.manning.com/baley" mce_href="http://www.manning.com/baley">www.manning.com/baley</a> where you can order the first four&nbsp; chapters (which makes it sound like we've written more). <a href="http://www.manning-source.com/books/baley/baley_meapch1.pdf" mce_href="http://www.manning-source.com/books/baley/baley_meapch1.pdf" target="_blank">Chapter 1 is free</a> and as a preview of it, the last sentence is: "The one thing about brownfield development that will double your rate as a consultant, repair your failed side career as a bass guitarist, increase your "performance", and make you a babe and/or dude magnet is....".</p>
<p>Couple of trivia tidbits:</p>
<ul>
<li>The guy on the cover was our third choice. First two were the Marquis de Sade and a hooded executioner, both of which we felt would have been more suitable for the topic. We settled on this one primarily because of the whiskey jug.</li>
<li>The TLA in the title is not an accident</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a <a href="http://www.manning-sandbox.com/forum.jspa?forumID=436" mce_href="http://www.manning-sandbox.com/forum.jspa?forumID=436" target="_blank">forum available</a> for reporting errors, omissions, and criticism (constructive, reconstructive, destructive, instructive, or otherwise-structive).</p>
<p>So there it is, folks. The first Igloo/Hillbilly collaboration.</p>
