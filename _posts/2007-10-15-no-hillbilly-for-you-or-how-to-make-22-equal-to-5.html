<p>Tried to respond to <a href="http://www.chinhdo.com">Chinh Do</a>'s comment on a <a href="http://kyle.baley.org/ASPNETDebuggingOrQuotHowToGetAttachedquot.aspx">previous post</a> this morning and lo! the Coding Hillbilly has been dubbed a social networking site by his employer. And Jayzus knows we don't want workers who network socially (unless it's for the United Way judging from the amount of ad space it gets on the company portal).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the <a href="http://www.baley.org">sister-aunt site</a> to this one is still deemed acceptable viewing.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm glad my employer has shown me the error of my ways. I was almost unproductive there for a second.</p>
<p>And yes, this post was written during normal work hours.</p>
