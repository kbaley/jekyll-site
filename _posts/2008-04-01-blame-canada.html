<p>I have a little secret. Well, more than one, but there is only one that I'm going to share today. By day, I'm an average (below average some would say) C# coder from the Great White North. Like most Canadians, I'm pretty quiet, and relatively polite. </p>
<p>I spend my days consulting for local companies. I take the odd trip to code camps (Victoria, Calgary, Phoenix to name a few) and user groups to speak about various things - TDD and Mono in particular. I even blog occasionally about various things related to .NET developing, but nothing to offensive because that wouldn't be... Canadian (eh).</p>
<p>And yet, by night, after the samoyed has been walked and the kids are put in to bed, I fire up my RSS feed aggregator and start making notes on so me of the things I read. All kinds of notes. Not always nice notes. Some of these notes get blogged. Now, how can I blog these not-nice things and still maintain the facade of a nice, quiet Canadian? Why, I use a nom-de-plume (yes, here in Canada we have French too). Yes, today I confess to the greatest mystery in modern times. </p>
<p>No, I was not on the grassy knoll on November 22, 1963. </p>
<p>Even more diabolical: I am the <a href="http://altnetpursefight.blogspot.com/">Alt.Net Pursefight</a> blogger. Yes, I am claiming to be the diabolical genius behind that blog. For those who were/are offended by the blog, you now can now Blame Canada for your displeasure.</p>
<p>Apologizes to Scott Bellware, who I understand is living in fear now due to everybody thinking it's him. The next time I see him I shall have to make amends with a bottle of <a href="http://www.laphroaig.com/">Laphroaig</a>. I'm sure that the presence of this single-malt will cause the <a href="http://www.igloocoder.com/">Igloo Coder</a> to crawl out of the woodwork, but this is the price of penance.</p>
