<p>Couple of short miscellaneous items to balance the tome I wrote last time:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Start Page in Visual Studio can be customised to show your own news feed rather than the default one. Go to Tools | Options | Environment | Startup. I'm also told you can use something like <a href="http://www.feedjumbler.com">http://www.feedjumbler.com</a>&nbsp;to collate a bunch of your feeds together into one which you can then use as the main feed for Visual Studio. I'm feeling &#8220;sign-up&#8220; averse today so I haven't checked out Feed Jumbler</li>
<li>You can also set the number of recent items that appear on the start page. Tools | Options | Environment | General and change &#8220;items shown in recently used lists&#8220;. Note that this also changes the number of items in File | Recent Files and File | Recent Projects.</li>
<li>There appears to be no way of getting rid of the Getting Started and Headlines sections.</li>
<li>Have been playing with the beta of <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">ReSharper</a> 2.0 and love it. Type &#8220;throw new&#8220; and it displays only available exceptions. Reference a class with no corresponding &#8220;using&#8220; statement at the top and it is added for you. Type &#8220;using&#8220; at the top and it displays the full hierarchy of namespaces available, not just the current level. And I've only been using it for a day. But it is uninstalling as we speak. Granted, my laptop is two years old and showing its age, but there is a very noticeable drop in performance of Visual Studio 2005. Plus I got some unhandled exceptions when working in a SQL database in Server Explorer. Tried to submit the error to help the developer folks out but that required me to sign up for something. See point 1. Regardless, when I upgrade my hardware and when they're out of beta, I'll gladly hand over $150 for it (pending a review of <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/CodeRush/">Code Rush</a>).</li>
</ol>
