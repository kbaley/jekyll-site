<p>It was pointed out to me that a Google search for "living in the Bahamas" brings up my <a href="http://codebetter.com/kylebaley/2008/02/06/life-in-the-bahamas/">original post</a> on the matter on the first page. That, along with a small but steady stream of requests for a follow up have brought me to where we are now.</p>
<p>To recap the first post. Bad = safety, general quality of tradespeople, variety of goods, cost of living. Good = weather, private healthcare, response time of good tradespeople (when discovered).</p>
<p>Most of that is still valid. There were over 100 murders in the Bahamas last year. And it was just shy of the record year in 2011. That's in a country of 300,000 souls. Toronto, a city of 2.5 million had less than 50 in 2012. Winnipeg, the so-called "murder capital of Canada" had about 30, if that, for a population of close to 700,000. The murder rate would place it around #5 in the list of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_cities_by_crime_rate">US cities with the highest per capita murder rate</a>.</p>
<p>That said, I don't know that I've ever felt that I was going to get killed here, except for the time I let my son shove a snail shell up his nose prompting a trip to the hospital alongside the woman I still love very dearly not least because of her infinite patience, tremendous ability to forgive, and outstanding fashion sense. I can't say for sure why I've never felt unsafe because it very well may be my extraordinary naiveté, which is both a blessing and a curse.</p>
<p>Trade quality is still spotty but after ten years, that's a problem that's easy to navigate now. Variety of goods has improved somewhat, especially with respect to grocery stores and telecommunications. A few months ago, the cable company increased our internet speed from 6Mbps to 30Mbps at no extra cost. And it's reliable enough that I know of at least one person who runs a production website on a server in his house. Cost of living is still high but  manageable. Don't discount your ability to adjust your lifestyle to match your income.</p>
<p>Now here's the thing: in a couple of months, we're leaving the Bahamas to move to the Dominican Republic. Not to follow our dreams but because the opportunity has arisen and we'd like to take it. We've had a positive experience with this kind of decision in the past.</p>
<p>I was asked recently by a Bahamian friend what I honestly thought of the country as a non-Bahamian living there for so long. This was amid one or two crises that seem to constantly grip the nation. Bahamians do like to talk a good scandal</p>
