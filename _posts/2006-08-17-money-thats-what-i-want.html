<p>I knew when I bought it that I'd have trouble with Microsoft Money 2006. And I did. Right after I bought it. Their download process is akin to trying to figure out <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038355/">The Big Sleep</a>. From what I remember, this is what you have to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install the trial version. You can't get around this</li>
<li>Purchase the full version</li>
<li>Start the trial version and wait for it to figure out you have a full version and update itself</li>
</ol>
<p>Sounds simple enough but I had no end of problems when I installed it about eight months ago. Problems that I've promptly forgotten but it wasn't a smooth process. I'll forego mentioning the little quirks with the product's functionality itself&nbsp;because I've <a href="http://groups.google.ca/group/microsoft.public.money/browse_thread/thread/5edaf68cc851d314/0d3051662bf14f6f?lnk=st&amp;q=%22money+2006%22+kyle&amp;rnum=6&amp;hl=en#0d3051662bf14f6f">already asked</a>.</p>
<p>Now here we are eight months later and I need to get it installed on my new laptop. Unfortunately, there is a new version of Money so it ain't easy finding a trial version of Money 2006. I did end up following a trail of breadcrumbs to *a* version of Money so I installed it, opened it, then waited for the update process to take hold, which it did. I thought things were looking good because it didn't say I had a trial version.</p>
<p>When it was finished, it said I needed to restart Money. Now, it <strong>does</strong> say it's a trial version and that my trial period has expired and what the hell are you using a 2006 product for anyway when the 2007 version is out? Don't you realize how much the world of personal banking has changed in 365 days?</p>
<p>Anyway, it's odd that products like Acrobat Reader and Paint.NET can pull off something like this but Microsoft can't.</p>
<p>Man, they'd better fix these issues or else I'll...I'll...probably whinge about it some more then shell out $50 for version 2007. &lt;sigh&gt;</p>
