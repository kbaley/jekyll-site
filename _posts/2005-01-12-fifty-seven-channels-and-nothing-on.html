<div class="Section1">
<p class="MsoNormal">Phew! January 12 already. Where DOES the time go? Apparently not to the Bahamian postal service judging by the rate our Christmas cards are starting to pour in.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So Liza and Syd are still in Canada. Haven&#8217;t heard much from them. A few days ago, Syd seemed in good spirits on the phone. I tried the age-old parental trick of trying to gauge how much she missed me but it backfired, as it always does. To add insult to injury, she started crying when I mentioned Tweety, our bird, and passed the phone off to Dolly, her aunt and publicist, who informed me that she wasn&#8217;t taking anymore calls until Tweety&#8217;s whereabouts and good health could be confirmed and arrangements could be made to smuggle him up to Canada in a crate of rum cake.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Not one to let daddy&#8217;s ego recuperate, Syd called again last night in tears because she saw a bird on TV and it got her going again on this stupid yellow ball of feathers that she never plays with when she&#8217;s home. My response was, &#8220;He&#8217;s fine. Honey, I&#8217;m just cleaning his cage in the bathroom and he&#8217;s&#8221;-- *FLUSH* -- &#8220;oops! Ummm&#8230;Ihavetogosweetieloveyoubye&#8221;. Let&#8217;s see how her five-year-old psyche handles some friendly mind games with daddy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Liza&#8217;s shopping list while in &#8220;The Village&#8221; includes a digital video camera about which I&#8217;m very excited. Now I&#8217;ll have cryptically names videos spread across three computers to go with the gigabytes of images with names like &#8220;IMG_7946.jpg&#8221;. Funny how the marketing for digital cameras no longer includes phrases like, &#8220;No more searching through volumes of pictures looking for the right one". Liza&#8217;s also planning to bring down some Tim Horton&#8217;s coffee but she&#8217;ll probably have to smuggle it in with a carton of cocaine to throw off the dogs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So what am I doing to pass the time? Well, a few nights ago, I caught the last half of a recent horror movie on HBO. It was the most amazing thing. I was absolutely mesmerized by its idiocy. I actually felt myself get more and more stupid the longer I watched. I was genuinely concerned that I wouldn't be able to perform basic motor skills by the time it was over. It became a personal vendetta to watch it to its conclusion and still be able to communicate in a reasonable manner with Sydney.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It was a tough battle. I actually flinched in pain with every moronic death scene. The acting winded me and the dialogue has left permanent scars but I persevered! Then, with my strength hanging by a thread, they tried to finish me off with a "twist" ending that was as unpredictable as a Roadrunner cartoon. And I have to admit, I considered taking my own life but then lo! The credits rolled and I was saved! A shadow of my former self, but alive nonetheless.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So yeah, I&#8217;m a little bored.</p>
