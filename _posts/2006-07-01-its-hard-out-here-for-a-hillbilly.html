<p><a href="http://atlas.asp.net">June CTP</a> of Atlas is out as of yesterday. Biggest change everyone is talking about is the ability to add UpdatePanels dynamically, something <a href="http://www.nikhilk.net/Entry.aspx?id=134">Nikhil Kothari</a> explains a lot better than I ever could. Not sure I've wrapped my head around the whole &#8220;control must be in the same naming container as the UpdatePanel&#8221; concept for ControlEventTriggers. Will have to try it out.</p>
<p>I have mixed feelings about this update. I'm glad their improving but I'm having a hard time keeping up with the current Atlas implementation and I fear I'm going to fall even further behind people like <a href="http://aspadvice.com/blogs/garbin/archive/2006/06/30/18988.aspx">Garbin</a>. *$%^&amp; hard trying to stay on the cutting edge.</p>
