<p>Yesterday, I cracked open the <a href="http://mvccontrib.org" target="_blank">MvcContrib</a> source code to see if it had....ummm...ok, I swear I was looking for something legitimate in there. But as soon as I updated the latest and opened the project, my eyes zeroed in on the TestControllerHelper class. So with a quick mutter of &quot;oooh, shiny&quot; to myself, I proceeded to what I knew would be the dearth of my productivity for the rest of my day.</p>
<p>Sitting here this morning, I can report to you that I am now one step closer to being able to adequately (but still not quite usefully) test controller actions that include a RedirectToAction method. Here's a sample test:</p>
<pre>[ Test ]
public void Test_redirect( )
{
  TestControllerBuilder builder = new TestControllerBuilder( );
  var controller = builder.CreateController&lt;LocationController&gt;( );
  controller.TestRedirect( );
  Assert.That( builder.RedirectToActionData.ControllerName, Is.EqualTo( &quot;Job&quot; ) );
}</pre>
<p>The <font face="Courier New">CreateController</font> method on my <font face="Courier New">TestControllerBuilder</font> uses Castle's <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/dynamicproxy/index.html" target="_blank">DynamicProxy</a> to create the controller. It also creates a <font face="Courier New">ControllerContext</font> using dynamic mocks from <a href="http://www.ayende.com/projects/rhino-mocks.aspx" target="_blank">Rhino Mocks</a> similar to the way Haackselman have <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2007/11/05/rhino-mocks-extension-methods-mvc-crazy-delicious.aspx" target="_blank">already</a> <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ASPNETMVCSessionAtMix08TDDAndMvcMockHelpers.aspx" target="_blank">showed</a> you and wires it up to the controller.</p>
<p>An interceptor is also attached to the controller to intercept calls to <font face="Courier New">RenderView</font> and <font face="Courier New">RedirectToAction</font>. (Actually, it intercepts all calls but only these two have special handling.) Calls to either method will populate an appropriate object on the builder class. In the example above, I'm using the <font face="Courier New">RedirectToActionData</font> object.</p>
<p>So far, this is all sweet and dandy like raccoon candy. I have indeed verified that it works as advertised. But at present, it seems to work only for controllers that have a parameterless constructor. Which is going to work for exactly none of my controllers.</p>
<p>I have a version working that allows you to pass in constructor arguments to <font face="Courier New">CreateController</font> and will submit it as a patch for MvcContrib, assuming it hasn't already been addressed.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I remember! I wanted to see if MvcContrib had the Flash feature I saw added to (but not yet used in) CodeCampServer.</p>
