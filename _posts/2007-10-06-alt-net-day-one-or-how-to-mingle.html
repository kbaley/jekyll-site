<p>First day of the <a href="http://www.altnetconf.com" target="_blank">ALT.NET<br />
conference</a>. I read the mantra for Open Spaces but didn't quite take it<br />
seriously: Whoever shows up is the right group. Whatever happens is the only<br />
thing that could have. Whenever it starts is the right time. When it's over,<br />
it's over.</p>
<p>Sounds pretty zen, especially for Texas. In any case, it looks like it will<br />
make for an interesting conference. And I'll be trying out these rules the next<br />
time I get in trouble from the missus.</p>
<p>We started off with introductions and a little round table thingy where it<br />
became clear that I have a different definition of "alternative" than others do.<br />
I&nbsp;thought "alternative" implied the use of unconventional ideas or a choice<br />
between two or more options. Seems there are a few people who took it to mean<br />
"something better than what Microsoft feeds us". Hope that doesn't become a<br />
prevalent theme because I'm more interested in getting tools for my arsenal than<br />
discussing what's wrong with any particular technology.</p>
<p>We did manage to nail down some topics for discussion for the remaining two<br />
days. Here is my agenda for tomorrow:</p>
<p>9:30 - 11:00 - &nbsp;&nbsp;Where is <a href="http://graysmatter.codivation.com" target="_blank">Justice Gray</a> and why isn't he here?</p>
<p>11:00 - 12:30 -&nbsp; Who is Justice Gray really?</p>
<p>1:30 - 3:00 -&nbsp; Agile development as it pertains to Justice Gray's hair</p>
<p>3:00 - 4:30 -&nbsp; How can we make Justice Gray a better developer in six<br />
months?</p>
<p>But despite at least one glaring omission, I've already met a lot of great<br />
people and I'm looking forward to continuing the trend tomorrow. And if I happen<br />
to learn something in the process, well, it'll still have been a successful<br />
trip.</p>
