<div class="Section1">
<p>Two weeks since anyone posted here and no riots. Nice to know you&#8217;re missed.</p>
<p>Apologies for the lack of one-way communication. Been kind of busy with the reverse-offspring visiting and, of course, studying. As it is, there&#8217;s probably a lot I could write about but I can&#8217;t remember any of it at the moment. But if I&#8217;m ever going to quit my job and <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,66679,00.html">blog full-time</a>, gotta keep the content going, I suppose. If only to attract readers without the sense to laugh heartily when I ask for donations for something that&#8217;s free. Perhaps I need more booger-themed posts.</p>
<p>So yeah, Ma and Pa are working on their last full day East of Paradise. They claim to have enjoyed myself which is probably true &#8216;cause they&#8217;re planning to come back next year (well, Mom is planning; Dad knows better than to get in her way). I joined them at <a href="http://www.myharbourisland.com/">Harbour Island</a> earlier this week where we spent part of the day on this beach:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img id="_x0000_i1025" src="/assets/beach.jpg" border="0" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll refrain from any &#8220;eat your heart out&#8221; comments to give you all a chance to stare at that picture a little longer&#8230; If it makes you feel any better, there were one or two clouds in the sky that day.</p>
<p>The people there are crazy friendly. Who says hello to strangers on the street anymore? The first couple of times it happened, I didn&#8217;t know how to respond so I went with a De Niro impression (&#8220;You talking to me?&#8221;).</p>
<p>More to come if my memory holds up.</p>
