<p>Have been asked a few times about when we're coming up to Canada next. Firstly, let me say: when are you lazy &amp;$%#s coming down here? We're the ones in the tropical climate. Or maybe you don't notice the white stuff you were shovelling at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>Anyway, we're hoping to come up to&nbsp;Manitoba this August or maybe July. That's as firm as the plans are for now but I'll post here when we have a better idea. Those of you that could act as a potential hotel for us will receive a personalized e-mail.</p>
