<p>Despite my strict mantra, "I don't do websites", here I am working on a plain old website. But thanks to <a href="http://www.templatemonster.com">www.templatemonster.com</a> and ASP.NET master pages, it's going pretty quickly.</p>
<p>But here's an odd thing with master pages. I have nested master pages and when I get to a content page (or another master page) that's two levels deep or higher, VS2005 no longer recognizes the &lt;asp&gt; controls in my HTML. They work just fine but the IDE marks them as errors ("not a known element") and they don't show up in intellisense...</p>
<p>...unless I open the master page(s) in the IDE (doesn't matter if it's design mode or source mode). In which case, all is right with the world again.</p>
