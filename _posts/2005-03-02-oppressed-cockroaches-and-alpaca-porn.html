<p>&nbsp;I think I&#8217;ve been here long enough that I think I&#8217;m justified in starting a list of rules for living in the Bahamas. I&#8217;d like to say this will be the first in a series but I don&#8217;t want to commit to anything just yet. So we&#8217;ll start slowly. The subject of this post will be:</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">&nbsp;Rule One: Shake It Out Before Putting It On</span></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The impetus for this rule arose yesterday, apparently to counter the positive aspects of living in the Bahamas (let&#8217;s look at that picture once again, shall we:)</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>So anyway, as I got out of the shower and unwrapped my towel, this Flaming Cockroach of Death leapt at me, with a cry of "LONG LIVE THE GLORIOUS COCKROACH REBELLION AGAINST THE GREAT SUBURBAN BOURGEOIS OPPRESSOR SWINE-PIG!" And lucky me, I&#8217;ve inherited my mother&#8217;s <a href="http://kyle.baley.org/archive/2004/10/04/208.aspx">tolerance</a> for bugs. So, naked, dripping wet, and doing my best to pronounce <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Wingdings"><a href="http://kyle.baley.org/archive/2005/01/22/311.aspx">b</a></span>, I ran from the bathroom to be comforted by my loving wife who always knows what to say to make me feel better (in this case: &#8220;Shut the &amp;%$ up, I&#8217;m trying to sleep!&#8221;). Fearing another attack if I got another towel, I eventually dried myself off with Sydney&#8217;s toothbrush.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Corollary to Rule One: Flush Before Sitting (and I SHAN&#8217;T elaborate)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Two other items of interest just to keep you on your toes. It has become clear that I am not meant to keep animals penned up. I&#8217;ve already accepted this with Tiger and Smudge and we&#8217;ve come to a tentative arrangement where they agree to leave the yard only after dusk and I agree to research British common law with regards to lawsuits from people who have been bitten by dogs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But you may recall that we have another <a href="http://kyle.baley.org/2004/10/anyone-own-a-black-and-white-cat-with-a-lisp/">pet</a>, a bird named Tweety. One day, two weeks ago, while ma and pa were visiting, Dad was kind enough to point out that Tweety&#8217;s cage (which we normally leave on the patio during the day to taunt Tweety with other birds who aren&#8217;t so immobile) appeared to be missing its key tenant. After fingerprinting, a full spectral analysis, and using the keen observation that the cage door was open, we determined that he had lifted his cage door and flown out.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The only natural course of action was to buy a new bird, of course. We waited over a week though and after six or seven days, Syd finally noticed the cage wasn&#8217;t quite as bird-y as it usually was. I wasn&#8217;t about to launch into a speech on the importance of taking care of your pets so I did what any parent would do: I outright lied to my child and said Tweety was at the vet&#8217;s getting a bath. A great line, by the way, &#8216;cause when Syd grew suspicious that the new bird looked different, I just said, &#8220;well maybe we should have bathed him earlier&#8221;.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Second item of note: the software that runs this little online oratorium has a feature that lets me see who is linking to it. Once in a while, I browse through it and it&#8217;s usually search engines searching for something obscure that I&#8217;ve written about (e.g. DefCon Five, Air Canada Customer Reviews, Massage Therapists in Bahamas). This morning, I notice that someone is searching Google for &#8220;<a href="http://google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22alpacas+mating%22">alpacas mating</a>&#8221;. Nice to know we&#8217;re reaching our target audience.</p>
