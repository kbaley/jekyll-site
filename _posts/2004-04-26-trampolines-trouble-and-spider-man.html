<p>Was a pretty domestic weekend, overall. We went to a birthday party for Keith, one of Syd's friends from school. Judging from the decor, Keith is a pretty big Spider-Man fan; even the bouncy castle had the webslinger on it. The big problem is that Syd's been taking notes for her own birthday party so now she wants two clowns, a Buttercup pinata, and a bouncy castle with a slide. I think my birthday present to her is going to be a great big life lesson. She'll thank me for it one day...</p>
<p>Spent some time in the pool yesterday, I think my first time this year. William and Ethan, Syd's friends from next door, helped us break it in. We are seriously lacking in pool toys, though. Later we pretended to be superheroes on the trampoline. (Syd likes to be &#8220;Action Lady&#8221; and I'm&nbsp;affectionally referred to as &#8220;Buttman&#8221;; guess what my &#8220;special power&#8221; is.)</p>
<p>Playing host to Pedro's sister and her husband for a couple of weeks. They're very nice and Frank is a legacy computer programmer so I'm looking forward to some war stories.</p>
