<p>One of the more entertaining and satisfying sections <a href="http://igloocoder.com">Donald</a> and I have written for <a href="http://www.manning.com/baley">Brownfield Application Development</a> is on Development Project Archetypes. That is, the types of people you encounter on a development project. Donald’s been <a href="http://www.igloocoder.com/archive/2009/04/01/development-project-archetypes.aspx">outlining them</a> on his blog for the last couple of weeks and is about halfway through the list. To date, he’s covered: </p>
<ul>
<li>The Ivory Tower Architect </li>
<li>The Absentee Client </li>
<li>The Disenfranchised Client </li>
<li>The Process-Heavy PM </li>
<li>The Front of the Magazine Architect </li>
<li>The Ex-Tech Project Manager </li>
</ul>
<p>Rest assured that developers themselves will not be spared before the list is through. Beware these people. And for the love of all that is hillbilly, don’t be any of them.</p>
