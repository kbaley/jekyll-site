<p>Took only three and a half months but we have finally moved into our new condo. You'll notice I didn't say we've *bought* a condo because the actual purchasing part has not gone through. The slogan says, "It's better in the Bahamas" but apparently, "better" is a relative term.</p>
<p>Pictures have been taken and remain safely tucked away in my camera never to be seen until I run out of room on the card. Maybe I shouldn't have bought a 2Gb stick...</p>
<p>In the meantime, it's located <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=25.021004,+-77.271518+(Chez+Baley)&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=k&amp;om=1&amp;z=18&amp;ll=25.021038,-77.271518&amp;spn=0.002358,0.005332&amp;iwloc=addr" target="_blank">here</a> if you want to stop by for a visit. It is only through the tremendous charity of the former owners that we have been allowed into the place.</p>
<p>Moving in provided a plethora of surprises ranging from pleasant to downright awesome. In the former category, the place was in fantastic condition. Not quite Liza-ready but as close as it is possible to get without pressure washing the walls until the glow with the light of a thousand suns.</p>
<p>Other bonuses: when they said fully furnished, they meant it. So much in fact that we had to get rid of some of it. Came populated with a sofa, loveseat, chair, dining room table, china cabinet, TV, dishes, cutlery, washer, dryer, fridge, stove, dishwasher, microwave, and beds in all three bedrooms (with sheets). It even came with shower curtains and towels.</p>
<p>The complex has a soft water system and our place also has a reverse osmosis tank wired to the water dispenser in the fridge as well as a drinking water faucet in the sink.</p>
<p>But the real bonus is the rest of the residents. On many evenings, the parking lot is filled with children as far as the eye can see. We arrived during one of these evenings (and I *really* hope those were speed bumps) and Syd was treated like a celebrity. Within ten minutes of walking in the door, there were three girls at our door (all on rollerblades) asking where she was. And when we left to get more stuff, she was doing the queen wave to her adoring fans.</p>
<p>And best of all: not one, not two, but THREE unsecured wireless networks in range from our living room.</p>
