<p>I swear I do code once in a while and my blog will reflect that again soon. But first, I want to follow up on my <a href="http://kyle.baley.org/DevTeachDay2OrQuotHowToPresentForStylequot.aspx">DevTeach presenter summary</a> for the remaining presenters I saw during the conference.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.ayende.com">Oren Eini</a> - Rapid web development with MonoRail</strong></p>
<p><em>Presentation Alias</em>: The Mentor    <br /><em>Underlying motif</em>: Experienced and practiced    <br /><em>Summary</em>: Oren's presentation had a feel of &quot;I've tried every possible combination and this technique is the best one&quot;. Although it was an introduction, he covered not only MonoRail but Windsor and ActiveRecord.</p>
<p><strong>Steven Rockarts - Generics: They're not just about collections</strong></p>
<p><em>Presentation Alias</em>: The Energizer    <br /><em>Underlying motif</em>: Laconic and unflappable    <br /><em>Summary</em>: For a guy whose last name is barely an anagram away from Rock Star, I was expecting at least a mullet. You won't see the words &quot;unrestrained energy&quot; in his evals but he's got a good Steven Wright thing going that is interesting to watch. And the guy is not fazed by anything.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://graysmatter.codivation.com">Justice Gray</a> - Microsoft MVC Architecture...what side are YOU on?</strong></p>
<p><em>Presentation Alias</em>: The Sex Magnate    <br /><em>Underlying motif</em>: Wanton and uninhibited .NET lust    <br /><em>Summary</em>: I'll confess, I didn't make up the presentation alias. I took it directly from Justice's business card (you probably think I'm kidding). He mixes entertainment (depending on whether you're the topic at hand or not) with hard-core tech talk like no other and dove pretty deep into MVC in a way people won't soon forget, even if <a href="http://www.igloocoder.com">Donald</a> really wants you to.</p>
<p>All in all, I'd love to see all the presenters again next DevTeach. Preferably at the bar after the session.</p>
