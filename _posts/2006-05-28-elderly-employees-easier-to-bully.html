<p>Code camp is done! Enjoyed myself immensely and even had a tinge of bittersweetness. I'm heading home in less than two weeks just as I'm starting to meet more and more interesting people.</p>
<p>Will post the code from my presentation shortly. In the meantime, just want to congratulate <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jbristowe/">John Bristowe</a> on his recent MVP status. Who knew he was such a master?</p>
