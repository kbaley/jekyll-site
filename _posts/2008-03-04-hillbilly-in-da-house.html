<p>Probably should have been more on the ball with this but I'm in Calgary for the week. Anyone in the area looking to eat, drink, and be merry, come meet me on Thursday evening around 7-ish at Joey Tomato's Chinook Centre (unless someone has a better suggestion but it had better be as good as, or better than, Joey's Ahi Tuna Salad). Hopefully, we can hit the theatre for a movie while I'm up here in civilization, too.</p>
<p>Comment here if you can make it.</p>
