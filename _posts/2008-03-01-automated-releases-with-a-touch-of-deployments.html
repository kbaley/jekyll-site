<p>One of the things I espoused in my recent presentation on Brownfield<br />
applications is automating your releases and your deployments for continuous<br />
integration. And being a good-natured hillbilly who has been a little lax on<br />
technical content of late, I will now turn your attention to that very<br />
topic.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.5em; padding: 0.5em; font-size: 10pt; float: right; width: 150px; background-color: rgb(221, 221, 221);">Note:<br />
Even though I mention this in the context of a Brownfield application, you would<br />
do the same thing to set it up with your Greenfield application as well.</p>
<p>First off, we should define a release and a deployment because they sound<br />
pretty similar.</p>
<p>A <b>release</b> is a packaged version of the application. That is,<br />
it is some artifact or group of artifacts that *could* be deployed if so<br />
desired. A <b>deployment</b> is the actual act of deploying a<br />
release.</p>
<p>A couple of notes on the definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>There doesn't need to be a one-to-one mapping 'twixt releases and<br />
deployments. You can create releases all the live long day and not deploy any of<br />
them.
</li>
<li>The reverse isn't true. You can't create a deployment without a release.<br />
Because, there ain't nuthin' to deploy, Jed! </li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few schools of thought on when to create releases and what to do<br />
with them. Which is another way of saying don't take what I'm about to say as<br />
gospel. This is how I've implemented it on my current project which has a<br />
development team consisting of The Coding Hillbilly 'n his alter-egos, <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/kyle.baley/archive/2008/01/04/monitoring-code-coverage-or-quot-how-to-descend-into-madness-quot.aspx" mce_href="../../blogs/kyle.baley/archive/2008/01/04/monitoring-code-coverage-or-quot-how-to-descend-into-madness-quot.aspx" target="_blank">Code Coverage Nazi</a> and <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/kyle.baley/archive/2007/12/13/guerrilla-refactoring-or-quot-how-to-bring-down-a-totalitarian-regime-quot.aspx" mce_href="../../blogs/kyle.baley/archive/2007/12/13/guerrilla-refactoring-or-quot-how-to-bring-down-a-totalitarian-regime-quot.aspx" target="_blank">Guerrilla Refactorer</a>. It's not without its faults which I'll<br />
talk about in the next post on deployments.</p>
<p>So with my requisite disclaimer out of the way, I create a release on every<br />
build. I.E. Every time I check in code, a new release is built. Wackiness?<br />
Maybe, but that's where the the Coding Hillbilly alias gives me a free pass. My<br />
advice is so easy to dismiss as the ramblings of a hick that when I eventually<br />
do say something useful, it's all the more meaningful.</p>
<p>Why create a release on every check-in? Easy, because I can. It's easy to<br />
create them so why not do so every time you can. That way, if the client says,<br />
"show me what you have" you can give him the absolute latest and, one might<br />
assume, greatest. What's the downside to having a release on each check-in?<br />
Wasted disk space? Give me half a day off and go <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136061" mce_href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136061" target="_blank">buy yourself something nice</a> with the savings. (Yes, I'm<br />
ignoring a whole lot of internal politics. Such is the benefit of developing on<br />
your own build environment.)</p>
<p>That's enough theory. Here's the NAnt task that creates my releases, with all<br />
subtasks merged into one. A summary of properties used follows:</p>
<pre name="code" class="xml">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;target name="release"&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;property name="current.release.dir" value="${releases.dir}${project.fullversion}" /&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;delete dir="${current.release.dir}" failonerror="false" /&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;mkdir dir="${current.release.dir}" /&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;copy todir="${current.release.dir}"&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;fileset basedir="${app.src.dir}Trilogy.Gunton.Web"&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;include name="Content*.*" /&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;include name="***.master" /&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;include name="bin*.*" /&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;include name="***.aspx" /&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;include name="***.asax" /&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;include name="***.config" /&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/fileset&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/copy&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;copy file="${config.dir}nhibernate-default.cfg.xml.template" tofile="${current.release.dir}nhibernate-default.cfg.xml"&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;filterchain&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;replacetokens&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;token key="SERVER" value="${database.server}" /&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;token key="DBNAME" value="${database.name.test}" /&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;token key="SHOW_SQL" value="${debug.show_sql}" /&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;token key="DATA_ACCESS_ASSEMBLY" value="${data.access.assembly}" /&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/replacetokens&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/filterchain&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/copy&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;delete dir="${latest.release.dir}" failonerror="false" /&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;mkdir dir="${latest.release.dir}" /&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;copy todir="${latest.release.dir}"&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;fileset basedir="${current.release.dir}"&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;include name="***.*" /&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/fileset&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/copy&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;/target&gt;</pre>

<p>Some these will become clear when I go through the build file. I won't add "I<br />
hope" because I GUARANTEE lucidity*.</p>
<p>If you look closely at the tasks in this target, it does one of three<br />
things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deletes folders
</li>
<li>Makes folders
</li>
<li>Copies files </li>
</ul>
<p>That's all a release is in my case. Elsewhere in my build file, I'm already<br />
building the application for testing purposes and as it so happens, I'm building<br />
it in the same way I would release it. This is admittedly a little dicey here<br />
because you may not want to do that. For example, you may want to compile with a<br />
different configuration for your releases. But it's not a pain point for me yet<br />
so the decision can be put off.</p>
<p>So, in order, here is what is happening (more explanation follows):</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the path to the new release we are building (based on the current<br />
version number). This uses the <a href="http://www.igloocoder.com/archive/2008/01/04/versioning-applications-using-nant-and-cruisecontrol.net.aspx" mce_href="http://www.igloocoder.com/archive/2008/01/04/versioning-applications-using-nant-and-cruisecontrol.net.aspx" target="_blank">CCNetLabel</a> property as described by Donald Belcham, whom I<br />
should have referenced long ago in this post because most of these ideas come<br />
from conversations with him.
</li>
<li>Delete the folder if it exists (it usually won't) and create/re-create it
</li>
<li>Copy the contents of the web application to the release folder
</li>
<li>Copy the NHibernate configuration template to the release folder and replace<br />
its tokens with values appropriate for the test environment.
</li>
<li>Delete the folder containing the latest release and re-create it. This is<br />
NOT the folder labeled with the previous release number. It is a subfolder in<br />
the releases folder that is physically named Latest. It will always exist<br />
already except for the first time you run this target (or if you physically<br />
delete it)
</li>
<li>Copy the contents of the current release folder to the latest release folder
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note on #3. We copy only the files we need to run the application. No code<br />
files and no project files here, bub!</p>
<p>Note on #4. The only reason I am creating a separate NHibernate file (rather<br />
than using the one already in the app folder) is because I want my releases to<br />
go against a different database than they do in the normal, everyday testing of<br />
the application. That database gets blown away and re-created every time I run<br />
my integration tests and I don't want that affecting any testing the QA<br />
department is doing on the latest deployment. So the database name is <font face="Courier New">${database.name.test}</font> rather than <font face="Courier New">${database.name.dev}</font>. Note that everything here is<br />
running on the same server so I don't need to differentiate the server<br />
names.</p>
<p>Note on #5. Why have a separate folder for the latest release that is simply<br />
a copy of another folder? That's the subject of the next post where I go into<br />
the deployment target.</p>
