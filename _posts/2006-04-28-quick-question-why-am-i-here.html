<p>There are two phrases that I simply don't allow people to say to me. They are: &#8220;quick question&#8221; and &#8220;simply&#8221;. Depending on its usage, &#8220;just&#8221; is just as questionable. (Yes, I know I've used&nbsp;two of the forbidden phrases&nbsp;in the last three sentences. The Coding Hillbilly is nothing if not a grammatical and hypocritical enigma.)</p>
<p>Nothing good ever follows these words so I have some canned responses when I hear them:</p>
<ul>
<li>You ask the question and I'll tell you if it's quick
</li>
<li>And why don't you &#8220;simply&#8220; fix that ticking sound in your car engine?
</li>
<li>I'll get right on that. I &#8220;just&#8220; have to rebuild this server first.
</li>
<li>The question may be quick. The answer won't. (Memory's fuzzy but I believe credit goes to Rajeev for that one.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Any other verboten words and phrases I should add? I'm always up for a little personal censorship.</p>
