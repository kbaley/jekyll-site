<p>Thanks to honorary Hillbilly Martin M for pointing out that my Search button didn't actually work.&nbsp;Let that be&nbsp;a reminder to all you Atlas-ers that your UI shouldn't just look good, it also has to work.</p>
<p>The migration to the new laptop continues. I shouldn't be too surprised at the level to which I bastardized my old laptop (I *am* the Coding Hillbilly, after all) but every day brings a new "oh yeah" moment.</p>
<p>Today's changes to the laptop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Imported IE favorites from live.com</li>
<li>Installed <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/default.aspx">Scott Guthrie</a>'s <a href="http://webproject.scottgu.com/">Web Application Project</a> for VS2005</li>
<li>aspnet_regiis'd my default web site (for some reason, I didn't have an ASPNET account)</li>
<li>Default settings in Word and Outlook (<span style="FONT-FAMILY: Century Gothic">I do like me some Century Gothic; it's the way the a's harken back to my childhood printing classes</span>)</li>
<li>Downloaded the Consolas font</li>
</ul>
