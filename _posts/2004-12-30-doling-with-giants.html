<p>&nbsp;Wow! Two posts in one day! Maybe the Miami Herald will hire me to replace <a href="http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/living/columnists/dave_barry/9994529.htm">Dave Barry</a>. And this one is even politically motivated. Note, however, that all reporting is based on &ldquo;stuff I&rsquo;ve heard&rdquo; rather than actual research so it is probably also factually inaccurate (which would probably make Dave Barry proud).</p>
<p>Disaster in the Indian Ocean. Over 100,000 dead and still counting. You can practically hear the groans from the CNN newsroom when someone&rsquo;s number in the office pool is knocked out of the running. But that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m hear to talk about. I&rsquo;ve been hearing stories of the aid &ldquo;pouring in&rdquo; from other countries. The number I&rsquo;ve heard from France is $100,000, an amount Sally Struthers would spit at. (&ldquo;For less than a dollar a victim, you can put on a good show and possibly gain re-election.&rdquo;) I seriously hope this number is inaccurate because Liza&rsquo;s boss is personally matching 5% of the contribution of a nation of sixty million people.</p>
<p>The next number I&rsquo;ve heard is $15million from the U.S., up from their initial gift of $7million. I imagine this is an initial disbursement but for the remainder of this commentary, I&rsquo;m going to assume it&rsquo;s the only one. Fifteen million is nothing to sneeze at and I&rsquo;m impressed the US is giving it out so quickly without performing a thorough background check on the Red Cross (who I&rsquo;m sure Rumsfeld has proven has ties to Al-Qaeda and Martha Stewart). But I&rsquo;m going to compare the contribution to the $40million some guy told me they spent on Bush&rsquo;s inauguration. Firstly, I&rsquo;m thinking they should send out for pizza the next time someone is elected president. Secondly, and I have no experience in throwing parties of this magnitude, how does one spend $40million on one party? I&rsquo;ve been to pretty elaborate parties for five-year-olds that have cost less than $1000 (and I think the comparison is fitting). But bashing the U.S. for frivolous overspending is too easy a target these days so I&rsquo;ll move on.</p>
<p>Canada&rsquo;s donation: $40million. God bless a minority government and Paul Martin&rsquo;s budget-slashing, surplus-building ways for proving that, yes, in fact you CAN buy publicity like that. Martin, like all Prime Ministers before him, evolved from a man of the people to someone who now thinks Acadia is a mythical land that sunk into the ocean, but kudos to him for showing him how the big boys manage a disaster.</p>
