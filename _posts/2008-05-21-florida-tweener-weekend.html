<p>I was invited to speak at the Florida Tweener weekend which is the weekend 'twixt the two TechEd weeks in Orlando. The <a href="http://www.devfish.net/articles/inbetween/session_types.aspx">schedule</a> is up and I had no idea what the scale of this thing would be! Not only is there a full day .NET code camp but also over a dozen other activities. The ones I'm excited about are the Day of Agile, the Day of Silverlight, the Open Space, and the Mickey Mouse Club.NET session. The last one's not on the schedule yet but I have high hopes.</p>
<p>For my part, I'll be presenting on Brownfield applications, mostly because I have the presentation ready (well, actually <a href="http://www.igloocoder.com">Donald Belcham</a> has the presentation ready). Luckily, I'm the first session in the morning on Saturday which leaves the rest of the weekend to drink it all in.</p>
<p>Oh, and don't be dissuaded by the registration process. &quot;Click to attend&quot; is an appropriate name given how much &amp;*%$ clicking you have to do to sign up.</p>
