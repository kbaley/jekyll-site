<p>I couldn't tell you what the minimum requirements for Office Enterprise 2007 are but if my experience is any indication, it's higher than:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows XP Pro</li>
<li>2.00 GHz Centrino Duo processor</li>
<li>1 GB RAM</li>
<li>256MB ATI Mobility Radeon X1400</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, it installs fine. But the hideous screen refresh time whenever I switch to Outlook and Excel's startup time are enough to have me revert back to Office 2003. And if you don't like my specs, ping me privately and I'll tell you why I'm glad I have them at all.</p>
<p>And credit where it's due on my last post on the Zune. You can create a playlist consisting of songs already on your Zune. You just create it on your computer first and synchronize. Despite the fact that the Zune appears to want to re-add the songs, it is smart enough to know when the song already exists on the device.</p>
<p>Two more downsides though. If I add a single song to my playlist, it has to verify the list's entire contents. Which takes a while for playlists in the hundreds of songs.</p>
<p>Second one: I think there may be a limit to the number of songs you can store in a playlist. I tried several times to synchronize one with about 2700 songs and the playlist simply didn't appear in the list. Worked with up to 1100 songs but I didn't bother checking further. See downside #1.</p>
