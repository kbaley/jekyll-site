<p>Oh my Sweet Jayzus, I just scared the&nbsp;living crap out of myself. My wife's listening to the soft hits station on TV and Air Supply's Even the Nights Are Better comes on...and...oh, jeezus, I can't even bring myself to type it...It's far too frightening. OK, Baley, suck it up and blurt it out...</p>
<p>I KNEW THE WORDS!!! Every single, *#$% sappy one of 'em. All the inflections, the slight key change at the end, the way he pauses slightly on "since I fooound yoooooou". I was god-damned pitch perfect.</p>
<p>Where do you run when your own mind is what scares you most? Along with Graham Russell and Russell Hitchco--OH GOD, I KNOW THEIR NAMES!!!</p>
