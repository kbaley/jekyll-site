<p>If I can break character for a moment:</p>
<p>Oh my lord sweet Jayzus, Joseph, and Mary, the stars of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071994/">Phantom of the Paradise</a> are coming to <a href="http://www.phantompalooza.ca/">Winnipeg</a>!!!&nbsp;Swan! Winslow! Beef! THE JUICY FRUITS!!!&nbsp;Non-Manitobans probably don't understand the reason for my excitement (or my disappointment that I can't go) but then, the movie probably didn't play for over a year in your city. For whatever reason, it was a phenomenon in Winnipeg. I missed the theatrical release but have seen the movie more times than I can count (and am severely&nbsp;ticked at&nbsp;the lack of a decent DVD version).</p>
<p>LIFE AT LAST!</p>
