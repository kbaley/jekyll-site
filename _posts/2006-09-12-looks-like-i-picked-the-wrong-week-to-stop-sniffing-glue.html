<p>I don't like linking to someone else's&nbsp;hard work&nbsp;unless I can add something to it. Having said that, <a href="http://www.nikhilk.net/Entry.aspx?id=139">holy crap</a>! Nikhil Kothari has added bookmarkability and the ability to add postbacks to a browser's history when you use the Atlas UpdatePanel. Not only that, you can control when and where a postback is added to the history.</p>
<p>How is this possible? I had simply written these two problems off as something AJAX developers would have to deal with until browsers caught up. I seriously picked the wrong week to start avoiding distractions from my other projects.</p>
