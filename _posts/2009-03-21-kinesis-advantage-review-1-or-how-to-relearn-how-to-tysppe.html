<p>Keeping this terser than usual. Got a <a href="http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/advantage.htm">new keyboard</a> three days ago and want to record initial thoughts. Follow up to come in a few weeks. For now: Freakin’ HATE it! Space on one thumb, backspace on another. Alt-tab requires same hand stretching exercises I did during piano lessons. Common coding symbols (e.g. /}{][=) hard to reach. No Insert key without activating keypad. Enter right next to Space.</p>
<p>Things that have helped: </p>
<ul>
<li>Dumping Launchy in favour of <a href="http://executor.dk/">Executor</a> (Better handling of file paths, can use space instead of tab for google searches) </li>
<li>Mapping CapsLock to Esc with <a href="http://www.randyrants.com/2008/12/sharpkeys_30.html">SharpKeys</a> </li>
<li>Mapping LCtrl+RCtrl to Alt-Tab and LCtrl and RWin to Shift-Alt-Tab through <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com">AutoHotKey</a> </li>
<li>Mapping F1 to Esc with SharpKeys (Is this key useful for <em>anything</em>?) </li>
</ul>
<p>Review unfair as still learning. Hope to return to sentences that don’t sound like written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorschach_(comics)">Rorschach</a> soon. Point in favour: no more pain in arm and wrist already.</p>
