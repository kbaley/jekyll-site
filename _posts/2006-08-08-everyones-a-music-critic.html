<p>Finally got around to working on the little <a href="http://www.suvius.com/musicplayer">music player thingy</a> I've been working on. Updates include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advanced search now working
</li>
<li>Made a slight change to the Atlas Control Toolkit to increase the fps for the CollapsiblePanel to make the transition a little smoother
</li>
<li>UpdatePanels now incorporated. The only postback that occurs now is when you click Play.</li>
</ul>
<p>The music library includes only the MP3s or WMAs in my collection, can't remember which. Adding the rest of them is probably my next priority along with something that indicates how many results were returned and how many are currently in your playlist.</p>
<p>As for other features, who knows? My publicist handles that crap, I'm just a programmer. So in the coming days/weeks, we'll see how many posts I can milk out of the work I've done it so far.</p>
