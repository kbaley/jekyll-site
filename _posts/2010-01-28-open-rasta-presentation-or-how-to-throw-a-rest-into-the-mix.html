<p>I’m imagining the thought process of some of the session voters for the upcoming <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/">Mix conference</a>. “Hey, here’s one on <a href="http://trac.caffeine-it.com/openrasta">Open Rasta</a> by the Coding Hillbilly. You know what would be funny? Let’s all vote for it even though he just submitted it on a lark to get some practice after taking time out from speaking engagements. It’ll be fun watching him explain to Mrs. Billy that he *has* to go to Vegas four weeks before he’s heading to Philadelphia for <a href="http://www.udidahan.com/training/">Udi Dahan’s course</a>.”</p>
<p>Yeah, you’re all a bunch o’ comedians, ain’t ya. Well, I’ll show you. You’ll go to my Open Rasta session ready to watch me squirm and you’ll see no such thing. I don’t want to overhype it or anything but I can tell you without a doubt that this session is going to restore your virginity and then take it from you again. Savagely (but tastefully; last thing I need is a bunch of people accusing me of statutory rape in the middle of a presentation). Then maybe next time you’ll think twice before crossing a coder of the earth, woncha!</p>
<p>Couple of interesting tidbits on the session:</p>
<ul>
<li>Somewhere along the line, the original title got changed. I submitted it with: “Open Rasta: The REST framework MVC wants to be.” </li>
<li>I also submitted a session on <a href="http://www.sharparchitecture.net">S#arp Architecture</a>. (What can I say? I’m a web framework kinda guy.) I found it interesting that the Open Rasta one got chosen and the #arch one didn’t. </li>
</ul>
<p>So while you’re waiting for Mix, have a gander at Open Rasta to see what all <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/kyle.baley/archive/2009/04/19/openrasta-or-how-to-speak-rest.aspx">the hubbub</a> is about. Between this and my new contract using Google Web Toolkit, that should set the stage for my post activity for the next few months.</p>
