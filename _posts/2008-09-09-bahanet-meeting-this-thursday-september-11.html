<p>Quick note to announce that Hurricanes Hanna and Ike haven't dampened our resolve! <a href="http://www.bahanet.org" target="_blank">BahaNET</a> is meeting this Thursday, hopefully at the <a href="http://www.ipbs.com" target="_blank">usual place</a> but I haven't quite verified yet.</p>
<p>Discussion topic will be source control. Specifically, how to set it up, maintain it, and use it effectively. It's a topic that is often overlooked but can become very cumbersome very quickly when not done properly. I'd tell you war stories but I'm guessing I can't top yours.</p>
<p>There will also be some interesting side topics so if you're in the area, it'll be a good one to attend.</p>
<p>Hope to see you all there.</p>
