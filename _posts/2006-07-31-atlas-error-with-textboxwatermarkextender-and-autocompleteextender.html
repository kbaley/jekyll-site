<p>This isn't really off-topic from my last post but I'll leave it at that for now...</p>
<p>I upgraded my <a href="http://atlas.asp.net/default.aspx?tabid=47&amp;subtabid=477">Atlas Control Toolkit</a> to the latest version and all of a sudden, I can no longer link a TextBoxWatermarkExtender and AutoCompleteExtender to the same textbox. I get a message: "Assertion Failed: Duplicate use of id..." etc, etc, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>In a rare show of common sense, I installed the latest toolkit without removing the previous one so I switched back to the old one and verified that it does in fact work on that version. The problem occurs only in the current (July, I think) CTP of the toolkit. They are <a href="http://forums.asp.net/thread/1347803.aspx">aware of the problem</a> so my solution will be to sit and wait.</p>
<p>Stay with me here. This is all going some place.</p>
