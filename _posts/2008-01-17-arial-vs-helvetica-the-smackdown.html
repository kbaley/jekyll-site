<p>This is a bit of a departure but what is a blog if not a dumping ground for random thoughts?</p>
<div style="border-right: #666666 1px solid; padding-right: 0.5em; border-top: #666666 1px solid; padding-left: 0.5em; float: right; padding-bottom: 0.5em; margin: 0.5em; border-left: #666666 1px solid; width: 200px; padding-top: 0.5em; border-bottom: #666666 1px solid; background-color: #cccccc">
<p>This isn't really the point of this post but I've never liked Arial. It's too &quot;squished&quot; for my tastes. I prefer the wider letters of <font face="Verdana">Verdana</font> or <font face="Tahoma">Tahoma</font>. But my current favorite font is <font face="Century Gothic">Century Gothic with it's big round letters that harken back to when I first learned how to print</font>.</p>

<p>I've never considered the difference 'twixt Helvetica and Arial before so I did a little experiment in Microsoft Word 2003 and Windows XP. The results are in the image below (click for larger version):</p></p>
<p>Here's your quiz. Comparing with the notes in How to Spot Arial, which block of text above is Arial and which is Helvetica?</p>
<p>And once you answer that question, here's a follow-up: What gives?</p>
