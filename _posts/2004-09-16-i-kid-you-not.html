<p>So there's another *%$# <a href="http://www.weatherunderground.com/tropical/tracking/at200411_5day.html">hurricane</a> coming our way. She's not as strong as Frances but she still blows, in every sense of the word (except the one I want). Preparations have resumed and won't be as intense as last time, if only because we haven't finished removing all our preparations from the last one (plus there isn't as much to blow over). There's still a chance it'll miss us especially at the slow speed she's moving. We're thinking of skipping the country and weathering it in the U.S. but whatever plane we're on will have to do some fancy flying to avoid the messes they have there.</p>
