<p>Condo ownership has still been good to us one month in. The glitter has faded a little now that we've lived in it a while and have found things to change and/or fix. The kitchen faucet was the first victim and we were lucky to find someone game enough to install it for us.</p>
<p>The fellow's name is, and I'm not making this up, Starsky Cartwright which is downright cool in a retro-TV kind of way. Mrs. Hillbilly was skeptical but he passed the test well enough that we've asked him to do a couple of more things. And he doesn't know it yet, but he'll be tackling some issues at Mrs. Hillbilly's place of bidness.</p>
<p>Other than that, second home ownership is keeping us on our toes. I dug out David Allen's <em>Getting Things Done</em>, which I bought over a year ago, but I haven't been able to find the time to read it. My theory is that these&nbsp;productivity books will always be popular because by definition, the people who buy them don't have the will power or the organizational skills to even read them.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll&nbsp;grab a used copy of <em>Seven Habits of Highly Effective People</em> to see how I can find the time to read <em>Getting Things Done</em>. But I really wish there were only three or four habits. Seven is way too many, man. This is 2007 for Jayzus' sake, I can't keep track of that many things at once!</p>
<p>In other news, two members of our immediate family suffered somewhat serious injuries yesterday. And guess what? NEITHER ONE OF THEM IS ME! No, I swear! I know if someone told me that someone in my family would take a header on the stairs and/or do a backflip while running in the parking lot, I'd wrap myself in three layers of bubble wrap the whole day. But the former accident was the missus and the latter was the young'un.</p>
<p>And from what I hear from onlookers, I'm not kidding about the backflip. While Syd was crying about how she couldn't go to school tomorrow, I said I'd give the nurse a call in the morning if she wasn't up to it and say she fell and hurt herself. Syd (through the tears): I didn't fall! I did a backflip!</p>
