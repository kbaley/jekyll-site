<p>Big news today is that I am gainfully employed again. The fine folks at <a href="http://www.ipbs.com">Data Systems International</a>&nbsp;have seen a glimmer of hope in my resume and hired me on full-time...sort of. To meet mutual interests, I'll be working only about nine months a year with them leaving me to find my own trouble for the remaining time. In the meantime, I'm once again riding the high of starting a new project and ready to confuse&nbsp;and befuddle another would-be employer into submission. Am still doing some contract work for Marriott and they see no reason to let a mere trifle like another job get in their way so I expect to by busy like my homeland's national animal for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Have also made somewhat firm vacation plans. Liza's sister is here until the 18<sup>th</sup> at which point, she will return to Calgary with Syd. Syd will stay there for three weeks and Liza and/or I will fly up there around August 7<sup>th</sup> and start a two week whirlwind tour of Calgary, Virden, Brandon, Winnipeg, and select areas of Lake of the Woods. We're now taking applications for groupies.</p>
