<p>Our Dutch guests showed us how to make pannekoeken (Dutch pancakes) yesterday and they were a big hit, especially with Syd although that probably had something to do with the mound of powdered sugar she dumped on them. She looked like an extra from <em>Blow</em> when she was done. Speaking of which, I forgot to mention that our day long excursion to the northern Exumas took us within a mile of Escobar's place where some of the events of <em>Blow</em> occurred. Not as interesting as wandering through the hills from <em>The Sound of Music</em>, I guess, but still damned exciting.</p>
