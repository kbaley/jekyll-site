<p>Sweet Jayzus, I have to&nbsp;<a href="http://kyle.baley.org/RhinoMocksOrQuotHowToExplainTheIntroductoryChapterOfAMockFrameworkquot.aspx">reveal my ignorance</a>&nbsp;more often if <a href="http://www.jameskovacs.com/blog/RhinoMocks305ReleasedWithExplicitRecordPlayback.aspx" target="_blank">this is going to be the result</a>. That's a faster turnaround than at your average Bahamian bank check-in counter!</p>
<p>So, James,&nbsp;I hate to mention it for fear of looking stupid but I'm having a little trouble writing this tiny piece of software to predict the stock market....</p>
