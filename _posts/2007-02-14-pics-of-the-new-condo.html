<p>It was more trouble than it should have been but pictures of the new place are now available <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/82423277@N00/tags/newcondo/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>The issue was definitely not with Flickr which was absolutely stunning in its simplicity and feature set for my first relatively in-depth use of the service. Their Windows Explorer support is nigh perfect. Nor was it with the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/digitalphotography/prophoto/photoinfo.mspx" target="_blank">PhotoInfo add-in</a> from Microsoft I used to help tag the pictures.&nbsp;It's a neat little Explorer add-in that will likely add to the guilt I feel for not finding time to organize my life into neat little montages.</p>
<p>The problem I had was with the hardware. I couldn't find a way to get the pictures off the camera on to my computer. Oh, I know how. But we just bought a new <a href="http://www.sonystyle.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/en/-/USD/SY_DisplayProductInformation-Start?ProductSKU=DSCT50%2fB&amp;Dept=cameras&amp;CategoryName=dcc_DIDigitalCameras_megapixels_7" target="_blank">Sony CyberShot</a> over the holidays (and despite what that link implies, it comes in more colours than that one but not necessarily better ones. Trust me on that.)&nbsp;Anyway, like most Sony products of late, it doesn't play well with pretty much anything else I have.</p>
<p>The media is a stripped down version of their Memory Stick which requires an adapter (included with the camera) to interface with any regular Memory Stick card readers you may have.</p>
<p>I had a heck of a time finding that adapter. When I did, I had a heck of a time finding the card reader to plug into. So much so that I didn't actually find it. So I looked for the cord that could connect the camera directly to the computer. When I did, I couldn't find the camera itself anymore.</p>
<p>My solution, use the old camera, the very capable <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&amp;fcategoryid=145&amp;modelid=10468" target="_blank">Canon PowerShot A95</a>, which was close at hand with all the peripherals, plenty of battery life, and more than enough space left on the CompactFlash card.</p>
