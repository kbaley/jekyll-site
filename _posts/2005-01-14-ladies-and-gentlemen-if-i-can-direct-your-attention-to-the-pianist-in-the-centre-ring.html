<div class="Section1">
<p>&nbsp;How many of you, my precious readers, have heard me play the piano? Hmm? Don&#8217;t be shy, raise your hands. That many, huh? OK, well all of you SUCK!</p>
<p>As I <a href="http://kyle.baley.org/personal/archive/2005/01/08/240.aspx">mentioned</a>, I&#8217;m recording some music for my dear old Grammy so she can delude herself that I&#8217;m a much better piano player than I actually am. In my previous post, I complained about the pressures of nailing a piece in one take. Since then, I&#8217;ve discovered the magic of editing on my computer and it&#8217;s done wonders for my ego. There&#8217;s something cathartic about being able to delete your mistakes, if only for one small part of your life.</p>
<p>So I recorded a bunch of pieces and started editing last night. The problem started with a piece called Sarabande by Handel. The tempo is listed as &#8220;Grave&#8221; which is pretty much what it sounds like. Slow and stately. Well, substitute &#8220;slow&#8221; with &#8220;festive&#8221; and &#8220;stately&#8221; with &#8220;unnaturally giddy&#8221; and you have my version. It sounds like there should be &amp;*$% circus bears prancing around. I followed it up with a version of Haydn&#8217;s Romance in F that would make Alvin and the Chipmunks proud then nailed one of Chopin&#8217;s Nocturnes, normally a five-minute piece, in less time than it takes Liza to recant for accusing me of forgetting her birthday (I couldn&#8217;t have planned that flower delivery better if I tried; Happy Birthday, Honey!).</p>
<p>My point is, I&#8217;ve obviously been playing like this for years. So where the hell were all of you armchair critics? Am I to assume that by &#8220;Sounds good, Kyle&#8221; you really mean, &#8220;I&#8217;d sing along but I&#8217;m not a Smurf&#8221;?</p>
<p>Of course, you say, why can&#8217;t I tell if I&#8217;m the one whose playing as if I desperately need to take a leak? Well, frankly, I don&#8217;t listen. I go through the motions. I press the keys I think I&#8217;m supposed to and do my best to hide mistakes but I don&#8217;t stop to hear what sounds are coming out of the piano. I do it &#8216;cause it&#8217;s fun, not to get any musical enjoyment out of it. I&#8217;ve been playing the Edelweiss Glide Waltz for nigh on twenty years and I doubt I could hum it in its entirety. Listening to it on the headphones, I&#8217;d forgotten what a beautiful piece it is.</p>
<p>The upshot of this is that I need to re-record about half the songs I&#8217;ve already recorded. Either that or re-think my <a href="http://gprime.net/images/mariopiano/">repertoire</a>.</p>
