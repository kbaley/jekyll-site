<p><a href="http://www.leadinganswers.com" target="_blank">Mike Griffiths</a> is a project manager based in Calgary and has an awesome blog on agile project management. I admit I don't always follow the hard-core estimation planning techniques but yesterday's post on the <a href="http://leadinganswers.typepad.com/leading_answers/2008/01/top-10-agile-es.html" target="_blank">Top 10 Estimation Best Practices</a> is Gold with a capital Guh.</p>

<p><strong>3. Agree on what &#8220;It&#8221; and &#8220;Done&#8221; means</strong> &#8211; make sure everyone is estimating in the same units (e.g. ideal days), have the same assumptions, and are based on standard developer ability/effort. When asking for estimates spell out what you are asking them to estimate. What does &#8220;Done&#8221; include? Coded, unit tested? How about integrated and system tested? What about refactoring contingencies? User meeting time?</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>10. Review, Revisit, Remove head from sand, Repeat</strong> &#8211; Our first estimates will likely be our worst. Don&#8217;t leave it there; review the project velocities to see how fast we are really going. Revisit the estimates armed with the real velocities to determine likely end dates. Embrace the reality you see, &#8220;The map is not the territory&#8221;, reprioritize and repeat the estimation process often to adapt and iterate to the most accurate estimates</p>

<p>It was originally titled the Top 10 Agile Estimation Best Practices but someone correctly pointed out that they applied to any estimation planning.</p>
<p>He has it available in handy PDF format and he's too polite to say it so I'll voice the implication: Put it up on the wall over top of the picture of your kids and read it every day!</p>
<p>Y'know, if you want to.</p>
