<p><font color="#ff1493">Question of the day:&nbsp; Why am I such a freak magnet?&nbsp; (No comments from the Testosterone Alliance...)&nbsp; Being shackled to a mortgage (but only for 5 more years) and thus deprived of a car, I pride myself on making the ecologically friendly choice of taking&nbsp;the bus&nbsp;to and fro wherever my life takes me.&nbsp; However, this mode of transportation brings me within close proximity of &#8220;the public.&#8221;&nbsp; Which I don't normally mind on most occasions, except when my Freakey-sense is tingling, which means I've had a crappy day, enough is enough, just get me home already.&nbsp; But no, Murphy's law had it's way with me last night, where every drunken weirdo, loser, and other dregs of society chose to sat near/next to me.&nbsp; Two drunken morons on SkyTrain, a chatty bus driver that drove 10 km an hour, stopped for every yellow light&nbsp;and talked to her &#8220;regulars&#8221; for 5 minutes when they got off at their stop, a guy that was SINGING on the bus when he wasn't talking LOUDLY to anyone around him about the passport differences of China and India, and some random wacko that walked up and down the aisle for no particular reason.&nbsp; I had to keep repeating to myself that &#8220;I'm an adult, and screaming 'SHUT THE F*** UP!' would serve no useful purpose&#8221; and praying for green lights.&nbsp; Now dear readers, being of the gentler and fairer sex, I am not inclined in the slightest to violence or swear, so this is not usual reactionary behaviour from me.&nbsp; But I tell you, sometimes I just reach my limit with my fellow earthly occupants and want to jump out of my skin and beat them to a pulp.&nbsp; Is that wrong?</font></p>
<p><font color="#ff1493">Anyway, I'm in a much better mood this morning, and even took the bus and SkyTrain&nbsp;at 7 a.m. to meet a friend from Toronto for lunch.&nbsp; (It helps to have a Starbucks every few feet as well, I love life in BC.)&nbsp; I have figured out that I'm still suffering from the latent effects of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, with the Mom-Lady having just left my house on Tuesday after a <u>MONTH</u>-long visit.&nbsp; I'm so happy she's retired now...</font></p>
<p><font color="#ff1493">I will sign off now, as I must get to Modern Burger and secure a lunch table.&nbsp; (Homemade sirlion steak burgers and hand-cut fries...drooooooool.)&nbsp; Will post again soon...</font></p>
