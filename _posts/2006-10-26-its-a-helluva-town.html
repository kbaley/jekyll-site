<p>Greetings from CowTown!</p>
<p>Good to be back in civilization. Have been here almost a week and forthwith is a list of things I didn't realize I missed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Slurpees (no 7-Elevens in the Bahamas; no, seriously)</li>
<li>Drivers who <a href="http://kyle.baley.org/FaithItYouThuck.aspx">take responsibility</a> for their actions</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ckua.com" target="_blank">CKUA</a> radio (arriving on a Friday night after 11 hours of flying; it was tremendously soothing to turn on the radio to Andy Donnelly's Celtic Corner)</li>
<li>Decent restaurants where tips are based on merit</li>
<li>Movie theatres where patrons don't shout advice to characters on the screen (go see both <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407887/" target="_blank">The Departed</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443543/" target="_blank">The Illusionist</a>; they rock)</li>
<li>The Calgary Zoo; young or old, it just rocks</li>
<li>Joey Tomato's Ahi Tuna Salad</li>
<li>Sunday shopping</li>
<li>And of course, family and friends, and you know who you are. Even got a quick visit to my younger brother who some of you may know from his exploits on <a href="http://www.baley.org/stories/SemenScandal.aspx" target="_blank">The Hillbaley Ho Down and Extravaganza</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Special thanks to Simon (who'd better get a technical blog soon) for chaperoning me the last few nights and for organizing lunch with Calgary's technological elite.</p>
<p>Apologies to the last minute changes which prevented me visiting <a href="http://graysmatter.codivation.com" target="_blank">Justice</a>, <a href="http://stevenrockarts.com/blog/" target="_blank">Steven</a>, and <a href="http://igloocoder.com/default.aspx" target="_blank">Donald</a>. My wife and I had to take some much needed down time after having dealt with <a href="http://kyle.baley.org/content/binary/therant.mp3" target="_blank">this woman</a> for the last few weeks (careful, it ain't exactly safe for work; and worry not, it's not as stressful as she makes it out to be).</p>
<p>With luck, we'll be back at Christmas. Without luck, you'll all have to wait until May.</p>
