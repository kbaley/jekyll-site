<p>I guess Hurricane Jeanne heard me talking trash about her so she looped around to take another crack at us. I don't think she'll do too much damage since she's passing by as I type this and we still have power and an internet connection. Was still a pain to do all the preparations again. I'll say the same thing I did after a snowstorm in Manitoba: "Who decided to settle this country?"</p>
