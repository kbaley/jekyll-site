<div class="Section1">
<p class="MsoNormal">There is nothing, repeat NOTHING, like banging out a tune on a full-fledged grand piano. I'll always have a spot for the one I grew up with (soon to be entering her 93<sup>rd</sup> year in existence, thank you very much) but MAN, Pedro's hunk of ivory can make anyone sound good. Liza's getting pretty good on the drums, too, and we've been practicing a couple of songs. She usually has to drag me to play along &lsquo;cause her repertoire so far consists mostly of songs that are pretty boring on the piano (the appeal of the Counting Crows does NOT lie in their songwriting abilities). But we've been branching into Sarah McLachlan and even slogged our way through a few pages of Rhapsody in Blue(!).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Still haven't been able to convince her to play along with the Muppet Show Theme Song, though.</p>
