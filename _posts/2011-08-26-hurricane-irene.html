<p>Getting tired of writing this in email format over and over again so herein lies my account of our encounter with Hurricane Irene.</p>
<p>First order of business is to dispel some myths. We live near Nassau which did not get hurricane force winds. They reached 60 – 70 mph sustained with higher gusts. Even still, I’ve heard reports that there were 180mph winds going on, even in the eye, which sounds like journalism by way of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers">Chinese Whispers game</a>. The winds hit about 120mph sustained in the eye while Irene was passing by us. That’s still plenty fast enough to cause major destruction but it still pays to get the facts straight.</p>
<p>As natural disasters go, hurricanes are fairly sporting. They give you plenty of notice before they bring down the fist of pain. We spend part of the day Tuesday and all day Wednesday preparing. We just got hurricane shutters in July and they are easy to set up. The majority of the time is simply making sure everything that could blow away is either secured or moved indoors somewhere. Not particularly hard or back-breaking work but it does take time and start wearing you down.</p>

<p>Final thought: Be careful when you use the phrase “come hell or high water.” Mother Nature <em>will</em> test you.</p>
