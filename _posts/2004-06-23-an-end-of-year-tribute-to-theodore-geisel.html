<p>End of year <a href="http://baley.vanmeurs.org/kyle/gallery/22.aspx">class party</a> finished today<br />Quite a blast it was, I must say<br />Twenty-odd kids in the fray<br />Though it felt more like fifty by the end of the day</p>
<p>So off we went on our foray<br />To Nicolas's house to play<br />The twenty-odd kids in Pre-K<br />Some parents, Ms. Collie and Ms. K</p>
<p>We couldn't ask for a more beautiful day<br />The sun shining high, not a hint of gray<br />Thank God for air conditioning is all I can say</p>
<p>The pool was a hit from the size of the &#8220;YAY&#8220;<br />That hit us when we arrived there to play<br />Then pizza and cupcakes, a veritable buffet<br />And a clown who did tricks, quite the display<br />Though I wouldn't necessarily call them tricks per se</p>
<p>All in all, we did OK<br />Though I can't imagine doing this every day<br />But all good things must end, as they say<br />So Ms. Collie announced, &#8220;We're on our way&#8220;<br />Prompting twenty pleas of, &#8220;I wanna stay&#8220;<br />And half a dozen parents: &#8220;NAY!&#8220;<br />Including the parents of one Sydney Baley</p>
<p>So much to the children's dismay<br />Back to St. Andrews, we made our way<br />The twenty-odd kids in Pre-K<br />The parents, Ms. Collie, and Ms. K</p>
<p>A more subdued ride home it was, I must say<br />At least for the parents, Ms. Collie, and Ms. K<br />The kids were still raring to play</p>
<p>I'm back at home now, recovering from the soiree<br />With the help of some vodka and perrier<br />Syd's outside swimming with Lauren K<br />Where they get their energy, I can't say<br />But they should both sleep well at the end of the day</p>
<p>So in closing, I just have this to say<br />&#8221;Good luck next year, Mrs. Masse&#8221;</p>
