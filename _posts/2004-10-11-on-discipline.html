<div class="Section1">
<p class="MsoNormal">Somewhere along the line, I turned into my father. Well, truth be told, I&#8217;ve managed to take the more &#8220;interesting&#8221; traits of both my mother and father and merge them into a personality that most sociologists didn&#8217;t think was scientifically possible. But for the purposes of this post(ulation),&nbsp; the hypothesy is that I&#8217;ve turned into my father and I will give some proof to back up my assertion (sorry, I recently started back into the mathematics world but that&#8217;s the subject of another post). And the proof is my bottom lip. Those of you in the know have probably figured out where this is going. But we&#8217;ll digress a little into child rearing techniques. Keep your shirts on, this is going somewhere.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Syd is a normal five-year-old girl insomuch that she has developed a five-year-old&#8217;s streak of stubbornness at times (augmented by her mother&#8217;s genetics). When it first surfaced, I tried doing the 00s thing and tried to make her aware of her behaviour and the negative impact it was having on our social being. Then I tried the 90s thing and attempted to reason and compromise with her. Then I did the 80s thing and offered her money to do what I wanted. Finally, I went through a 60s phase where I just let her do what she wanted (I&#8217;m among the many who refuse to acknowledge that the 70s existed).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Where my father comes in is in my newest technique. When Syd started showing signs of rebellion, I used to send her to her room calmly and quietly. She didn&#8217;t like it but she never disobeyed. Until recently. That&#8217;s when my bottom lip started disappearing. I know from personal experience that one of the most feared expressions on a father is when his bottom lip disappears and he starts speaking through his teeth. My brothers will back that up. The first time I did it was quite by instinct:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Kyle (calmly): &#8220;Syd, go to your room&#8221;<br />Syd (not so calmly): &#8220;NO!&#8221;<br />Kyle (incredulously): &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, what?&#8221;<br />Syd (less calmly): &#8220;NO!&#8221;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is the point where instinct kicked in. The lip vanished, the teeth slammed shut, and I heard someone say in my voice, slowly: &#8220;I said, go to your room&#8221;. The response was absolutely stunning. From the first word, she jumped three feet in the air and was halfway up the stairs before I finished the sentence. Not sure what nerve that expression touches but if it&#8217;s not patented, I plan to make a lot of money from it.</p>
