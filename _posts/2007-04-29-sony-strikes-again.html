<p>I really gotta stop trusting Sony to hold up their end of a bargain in a basic retail transaction. What with recent debacles like the spyware, the exploding batteries,&nbsp;the&nbsp;I-can-get-two-Wiis-for-the-price-of-one PlayStation3,&nbsp;and their overall blind faith that everything they do is for the public good, I still figured&nbsp;they were sold in the TV department...</p>
<p>We recently purchased a 46" Sony Bravia TV in Miami and shipped it to the Bahamas, an idea which sounds more ominous now that I type than it did when we went through with it. It shipped and problems started in week one. In the first couple of days, we noticed a ticking noise in the top right hand side but that seems to have gone away.</p>
<p>What hasn't gone away is a three-inch stripe along the right edge of the screen. It's colour varies depending on what's on the screen. When the screen is black, the stripe is a dark red. When the screen is green (i.e. for football/soccer games), the stripe is yellow. You can still see the picture underneath but all the same, we've taken to viewing things in normal mode rather than widescreen.</p>
<p>Give them credit: their voice response system is pretty good, even if it follows the recent creepy trend of having a computer pretending to talk to you. ("Hmmm....I can't seem to find your order.") I made my way to an agent relatively quickly. She was polite and friendly and ran me through a minimum of troubleshooting before deciding that I needed a technician, which I already knew. (On a side note: I think I've said this before but every home should come standard with a portable phone with speakerphone and a mute button in the handset.)</p>
<p>But according to Sony, the Bahamas is part of Latin America. This struck me as odd because while I always knew Bahamas spoke a different language (to take two quotes from recent political pamphlets of a federal party: "Ain't Long Now" and "We Votin' Dem Out!"), Spanish it ain't. And unfortunately, this meant having to call Sony in Mexico, <em>just to find a licensed Sony service centre in the Bahamas</em>. And guess what? Sony Mexico's voice response system is all Spanish. As in, there is no: Press 2 for English.</p>
<p>I got two levels deep in their system before chickening out and deciding to waiting for Mrs. Hillbilly who speaks Spanish. That's kind of where it stands now&nbsp;but I'm not holding out hope that a Sony centre exists here. There is a bit more to it but that's a post for the <a href="http://kyle.baley.org/">technical arm</a> of the Bahamian Hillbilly which will be forthcoming.</p>
