<p>I'm going to pretend you don't already know this but the <a href="http://calgarycodecamp.com/portal/" target="_blank">Calgary Code Camp</a>&nbsp;is a mere two weeks away and it looks like it will surpass last year's in every way except one. Namely, I won't be presenting or attending. Which is just as well. My taste in music <a href="http://graysmatter.codivation.com/CalgaryCodeCamp2AJAXATLASTheHotnessContinues.aspx" target="_blank">hasn't improved</a> any. (MAN, Norah Jones' new CD rocks, metaphorically speaking.)</p>
<p>Normally, a nine-hour plane ride with a three-hour layover in TO wouldn't be enough to keep me from a Bil Simser/John Bristowe tag-team and the one titled Meet the Monkey almost sealed the deal but a $10k shopping trip to Miami to furnish our new condo (which previously contained furniture that looked like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120202/quotes" target="_blank">Edith Head puked and that puke designed it</a>) put a big kibosh on that little cross-continental jaunt.</p>
<p>So, dear reader(s), it is up to you to be my eyes and ears. I need you to get up close and personal with the presenters. I'm talking INTIMATE. I want to be able to smell the&nbsp;soy-based food products on James Kovacs'&nbsp;breath when you report back to me. I want to know what JP's stimulant of choice is before he goes on. I want to know&nbsp;if Tom Opgenorth can make it through his presentation without giggling whenever he says Mono.</p>
<p>The one with the best use of clandestine tactics gets a free tour of Anna Nicole's house.</p>
