<p>The code from my Mix presentation on building REST applications with OpenRasta <a href="http://baley.org/Mix2010.zip">can be found here</a>. Check out the ReadMe file to get started.</p>
<p>The app is a very basic music library. The home page lets you enter the path to a folder containing MP3 or WMA files and it will load a database table with the metadata from those files.</p>
<p>If you have any trouble, please post in comments so I can respond for the greater good. Similarly, I can make this available via Subversion or Git if there is enough interest.</p>
<p>If you didn’t watch the presentation and are wondering about the pink, I made a little detour about company naming strategies in order to explain why I chose Flamingo for the name. It’s a well-rehearsed spiel that I’ve been making <a href="http://kyle.baley.org/2007/04/n-there-was-much-rejoicing/">for some time now</a> so I shan’t elaborate here.</p>
