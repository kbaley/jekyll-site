<p>Why, <a href="http://www.altnetconf.com">I do</a>, dear gatekeeper. And I can't think of any branch of software development more alternative than hillbilly development (as it were). Potential topics for discussion:
<ul>
<li>Backwoods-Driven Design</li>
<li>The family tree problem: Is it really NP-complete?</li>
<li>The open/closed principle as it applies to farm critters</li>
<li>Mashups (aka Moonshine Development)</li>
<li>Beauty</li>
</ul>
<p>Lookin' forward to seein' all my software developin', system analyzin', enterprise architectin', red-green-refactorin', unit-testin', domain-driven cousins out yonder in Austin! The Hillbilly will be there repreSENtin'!</p>
