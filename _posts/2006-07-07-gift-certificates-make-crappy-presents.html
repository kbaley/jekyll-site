<p>The attached application is designed to demonstrate AJAX and Atlas techniques. It's an annotated version of the one I presented at the <a href="http://www.calgarycodecamp.com">Calgary Code Camp</a>. It includes a sample ASP.NET application, a non-Atlasized AJAX version of the same application, and an Atlas version that uses UpdatePanels. It also includes a half-finished version that demonstrates declarative scripting and another one that shows how you can call web services from Javascript as well as how you can use the sample extender providers that come with the Atlas Control Toolkit.</p>
<p>So download the code and start wading through if you like. It's heavily commented but <a href="mailto:kyle@baley.org">contact me</a> if you have questions.</p>
