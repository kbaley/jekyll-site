<p>Fifteen movies in and I'm starting to feel the burn. Had to get up early this morning for Adrift in Manhattan (see <a href="http://thedarkhalfofthedarkhalf.yuku.com/topic/970/Review-Adrift-in-Manhattan">review</a>) which wasn't quite worth getting up early for. We started to get cocky in our ticket trading by selling tickets to a later movie to fellow Sundancers without picking up a replacement for it. But we had confidence in our "nice guy" status and when we made our way to the box office after the morning movie, our faith was not unfounded and we managed to pick up tickets not only to King of California (see <a href="http://thedarkhalfofthedarkhalf.yuku.com/topic/967/Review-King-of-California">review</a>) later in the evening, but Black Snake Moan on Saturday night. Best of all, we don't have to go back to Park City for the rest of the trip!</p>
<p>We haven't had any trouble finding good seats for our movies. I'm chalking that up to our stellar organizational skillz which I'm sure comes as no surprise to anyone who knows us. We've taken to watching movies in or near the back row. It's actually pretty liberating. There's rarely a mad rush to the back and we can make a quick exit when the Q&amp;A sessions get boring. (At a screening of Joshua about a 10-year-old boy who terrorizes his family: What was your inspiration for the movie?). We also tend to sit at the end due to the fact that Ian's bladder is smaller than that of your average hamster.</p>
<p>Rounding out the list of movies for Ian's birthday was Dedication (see <a href="http://thedarkhalfofthedarkhalf.yuku.com/topic/968/Review-Dedication">review</a>) which you should see if it comes to your area.</p>
<p>Both Dedication and King of California had interviews with the directors afterward which is usually a hit and miss affair. Not surprisingly, Justin Theroux was the most fun probably since he's an actor. At the very least, he's able to give a mildly amusing response to crappy questions. Most of the other directors/writers just looked uncomfortable. But then, you probably would too if you had to answer questions about why Michael Douglas would want to star in your movie.</p>
<p>A lot of clapping going on in the theatres, too. The first round comes when the Sundance rep comes out and says, "Welcome to Sundance." Then again when he or she introduces the movie. Then when the movie ends. Round four when the director is brought up and finally when he leaves. I've taken to holding up a sign saying, "It's just a movie" to save my sensitive palms.</p>
<p>In the line for Dedication (in Salt Lake City), we met a couple who have an apartment in Park City although from the size of the rock in the woman's finger, it's hard to tell whether they actually live there. In any case, she was claiming that you don't feel the festival atmosphere in Salt Lake City but that it "permeates the air" in Park City. Being polite Canadians, we kept our thoughts about what *really* permeates in Park City to ourselves. For the record, I'm pretty sure it's pixie dust.</p>
