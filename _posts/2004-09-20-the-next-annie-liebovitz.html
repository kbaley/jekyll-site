<p>So I was letting the dogs run around and had the camera in my hand for whatever reason. Syd was helping tire out the dogs but truth be told, I let her tag along to tire her out, too. She reached for the camera and said, &#8220;I wanna try&#8221;. Being a parent, my first reaction is, of course, &#8220;Not a chance!&#8221; Then, I thought, &#8220;It's a digital camera. It's past its prime. What harm could she do?&#8221; So I handed it over and she ran with it. Literally and figuratively. She took pictures of anything and everything. Before you could say, &#8220;I'm ready for my close-up&#8221; she had used up the remaining sixty, count 'em, sixty pictures on the card. Yet another point for digital cameras.</p>
