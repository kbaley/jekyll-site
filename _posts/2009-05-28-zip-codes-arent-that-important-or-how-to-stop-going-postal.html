<p>There is some discussion on a group about countries and states and cascading and such. Essentially centring around the ideas that: a) not every country has states/provinces/islands/territories, and b) some countries *are* states (e.g. Singapore, which also apparently does triple-duty as a city, who knew?).</p>
<p>As an addendum to that, I would also like to point out that not every country has zip/postal codes either. SO STOP MAKING THE &amp;*%$ THINGS MANDATORY!</p>
<p>In short, if you’re going to list a country as an option, be mindful of its idiosyncrasies.</p>
