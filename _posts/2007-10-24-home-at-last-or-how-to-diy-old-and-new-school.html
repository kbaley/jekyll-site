<p>Breaking form here by making someone else's link the sole topic of this post without adding anything other than kudos. But it's a really good link and it plays to my technical and musical leanings.</p>
<p>Props to <a href="http://www.intellectualhedonism.com">Carl Franklin</a> for a very impressive rendition of <a href="http://perseus.franklins.net/homeatlast/">Home At Last</a>&nbsp;(via <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CarlFranklinDoesSteelyDansQuotHomeAtLastquotViaSilverlightHD720p.aspx">Scott Hanselman</a>). All four instruments *and* vocals (one can only assume he's doing backing vocals himself as well). Puts my own little <a href="http://radio.baley.org/songs/Money%20(Glengarry%20Mix).mp3">flirtation with mixing</a>&nbsp;from a few years ago, in the form of quotes from <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0104348/">Glengarry Glen Ross</a> intermingled with Pink Floyd's Money (sometimes very badly), into perspective. (Note: if you've seen the movie, you already know this but for those who haven't, that "flirtation" link is probably not safe for work. Carl's is.)</p>
<p>And yes, an e-mail has been sent to Carl to audition for Hillbilly Idol.</p>
