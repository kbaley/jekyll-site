<p><font color="#ff1493">&#8220;Spongebob Squarepants is Gay.&#8221;&nbsp; No, that is not a blatantly incendiary comment intended to start an elementary school jihad, that is a headline from the daily newspapers appearing around the world.&nbsp; Is nothing sacred or innocent left, that cartoons now have to have some deep, hidden sexual identity agenda?&nbsp; When I was a child, I didn't for one moment remotely think about the sexual orientation of the cartoons I watched -- heck, I didn't even think about Fred and Daphne maybe being a couple until I was an adult and saw the Live Action movies!&nbsp; Let kids be kids, for pity's sake.&nbsp; They grow up fast enough as it is.&nbsp; And besides, innocent people are being beheaded in Iraq, genocide is being ignored by first world countries, the region of Indonasia has lost 215,000+ people in one swoop, and this is news?&nbsp; I wonder what the Rev. Falwell has to say...</font></p>

<p><font color="#ff1493">All right, allow me to introduce myself.&nbsp; (And no, I'm generally not that politically charged...I'm a die hard&nbsp;Conservative, and I live in BC.)&nbsp; I am Jocelyn, the ever cute and most favourite cousin of the Hilbaleys, and I will be adding a much needed dose of femininity to said website (hence my Username:&nbsp; The Estrogen Defensive.)&nbsp; I am new to this &#8220;blog&#8221; thing, so please bear with me, dear readers.&nbsp; I am also a natural blonde, and an only child, which lends itself to certain eccentricities.&nbsp; But hey, if you want dirt on any of of the guys, drop me an e!&nbsp; :o)</font></p>
