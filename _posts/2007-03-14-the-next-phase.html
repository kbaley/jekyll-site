<p>The Coding Hillbilly has been neglectful of his readership lately and for that, I apologize. I'd like to say it's because I've had nothing interesting to say but I don't want to invite comments about the quality of past posts. Let's just say I've been busy since that usually elicits few questions and knowing nods.</p>
<p>I'm entering Professional Development mode for the next little while. Not sure for how long but according to the <a href="http://www.jpboodhoo.com/blog/GettingStartedLearningSomeNewDeveloperHabits.aspx" target="_blank">mantra I've decided to adopt</a>, it could be upwards of 2 years, although I'm confident I'll have it done much sooner. I'm targeting for the end of this post.</p>
<p>My first stop has been <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_blank">Subversion</a>, which I've ignored long enough, mostly because&nbsp;version control systems&nbsp;fall under the category of "wholly uninteresting" in my books. It's a whole different system than what I'm used to (and I don't mind admitting that that's SourceSafe) but thanks to <a href="http://blog.surfulater.com/2007/02/28/get-up-and-running-with-tortoisesvn-and-subversion-in-15-minutes/" target="_blank">Surfulator</a>, I was up and running in twenty minutes. My lawyers will be contacting the Surfulator about the extra five minutes.</p>
<p>Next up will be to spend some more quality time with NAnt (and/or MSBuild) and CruiseControl than I have in the past few years. I was pretty proficient with NAnt back in the early 21st century but more recent projects have usually eschewed "doing it right" in favour of "doing it fast". And I have to admit to feeding this somewhat because I can work pretty fast when I'm not doing things right.</p>
<p>But it's getting old sitting by the sidelines while everyone else in my Blogroll spews terms I have to figure out from their context. And the time is nigh where I have to put more thought into the projects I accept even though the laissez-faire method has done me no harm for the last ten years (sweet Jayzus, has it been that long?!?).</p>
<p>That's right, folks. You're now reading the meanderings of a Hillbilly with a Mission!</p>
<p>Not to be confused with a <a href="http://www.devilducky.com/media/58566/" target="_blank">Hobo with a Shotgun</a>.</p>
