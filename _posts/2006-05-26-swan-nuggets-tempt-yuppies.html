<p>I'm all prepped for my presentation at this Saturday's <a href="http://www.calgarycodecamp.com">Code Camp</a>. If you're at all interested in client-side web development, you won't want to miss it. The app I'm presenting is cool enough but wait'll you see what <a href="http://atlas.asp.net">Atlas</a> can (and can't) do. You'd better come out or else I...ummm....won't see you there...I guess.</p>
