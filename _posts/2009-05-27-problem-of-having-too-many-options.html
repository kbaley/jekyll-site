<p>I don’t own a cell phone but I love me my iTouch (which, in fact, is the missus’ cast-off from when she got an iPhone). Given the amount of time I spend waiting for things to happen, being able to whip the thing out to play with at any ti---actually, I’m gonna stop this analogy and move on…</p>
<p>One of the apps I bought on it was Solebon, which is a list of approximately 6,899 solitaire games by my last count. I had downloaded the free version which had about six games. I liked a couple and had a blast with it. So I figured that would scale if I bought the full version. But these days, I never play the thing.<a href="http://kyle.baley.org/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/Problemofhavingtoomanyoptions_12DFA/image_2.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; margin: 5px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" align="right" src="/assets/image_thumb.png" width="244" height="203" /></a></p>
<p>The reason for that is exactly the reason I bought it: more choices. I thought if I like two games out of six with the free version, then surely I’d like at least ten or so games in the paid version. But whenever I open it up for a “quick” game of something, I’m faced with a screen of thirty odd games to choose from, most of them with cryptic names like “Ambrose” or “Blind Alleys” or “Eight Out”.</p>
<p>There are simply too many to keep track of for me to figure out which ones I might like on a regular basis. And the “random game” feature is only marginally better because I always need to re-read the rules to whatever game I’m playing. In the end, I usually just skip over Solebon and go straight for the stand-alone Cribbage app I also got. Sure it doesn’t show the time at the time and it doesn’t always count points properly. But I don’t have to put any thought into it before I start the game.</p>
<p>This ties back to a project I’m working on, one in which the developers have free reign to decide on which features to include. And as a developer, my naturally tendency is “the more the better”. But as a <em>user</em>, it’s “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Think-Common-Sense-Approach-Usability/dp/0789723107">don’t make me think</a>”. Even during software installations, ninety percent of the time, I select Custom and proceed to accept all the defaults anyway.</p>
<p>Because of this, my teammate and I have been fairly ruthless in deciding on features. Unless it is something that 80% of users can absolutely not do without, it’s on our fictitious “future release” board.</p>
<p>One of the things that has <em>seriously</em> helped us in this regard is <a href="http://www.balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a>. Admittedly, I got a free license for it, but my partner didn’t and he has extolled its virtues on numerous occasions. I suspect we have saved ourselves many thousands of dollars but not working on features that may have seemed like no-brainers until we actually saw them in the context of a screen mock-up. Even something simple like an admin CRUD screen hasn’t gone unscathed. “Do we really need four columns? Will users actually care if they are able to upload a headshot?” BAM! Three days work, gone!</p>
<p>Obviously, this has the advantage of making the product easier to develop (at least in the short-term). But there’s another benefit. No user likes to have <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/14/twitters-spectacularly-awful-24-hours/">features taken away</a>. Even if they are so obscure that only 3% of people use them, those 3% can be pretty vocal when they want to be.</p>
