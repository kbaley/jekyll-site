I've been working in the software industry since 1998, primarily in the Microsoft world of .NET with sprinklings of other technologies such as SharePoint, Livelink, RPG, and Java to name a few you probably won't see on my resume.

I've spoken frequently at user groups and conferences and, for the moment, blog primarily at [WesternDevs](http://www.westerndevs.com) and [CodeBetter](http://www.codebetter.com). The content here is primarily for archival purposes so I can relive my trip to [Sundance](http://kyle.baley.org/2007/01/the-sundance-chronicles-a-recap/).
